The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control in its latest report said the country recorded 558 cases and eight deaths across 32 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory between 2017 and 2022. The announcement came after the UK health authorities announced that a traveller from Nigeria tested positive for Monkeypox infection. Monkeypox is a smallpox-like virus that leaves victims with a painful rash that can be fatal if not properly treated. Monkeypox is mostly transmitted to people from wild animals, but human-to-human transmission also occurs. The disease can be contracted if an individual comes in contact with lesions, body fluids, respiratory droplets, and contaminated materials of an infected person.  Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, exhaustion, and a particular pox-like skin rash that develops across the body, including the palms of hands and the soles of feet.
