Mozambique continues to feel the growing impact of the climate crisis, which is amplifying vulnerability, driving displacement, and making life harder for refugees, the internally displaced, and host communities. Since the start of 2022, the southern African country has been battered by five tropical storms and cyclones along its northern coastal areas. These have affected thousands of families, including refugees and people internally displaced by ongoing violence in the northern province of Cabo Delgado - illustrating once again how the effects of climate change interact with many of the root causes of displacement. Most recently, on March 11, 2022 Tropical Cyclone Gombe affected more than 736,000 people, including those in the Corrane site for internally displaced people and refugees in Maratane settlement. In Maratane, 80% of shelters were damaged, and more than 27,000 refugees, asylum-seekers and host community members are still in urgent need of assistance, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
