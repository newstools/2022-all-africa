After being blocking Ugandans sugar for over three years Tanzania has had a change in mind and accepted Ugandans sugar into their market. This comes shortly after Tanzania President Samia Suluhu Hassan visited Uganda for a two day official visit on President Yoweri Museveni's invitation. During the meeting, the two leaders noted the growing trade between the two countries but also directed the responsible ministers to immediately remove any outstanding non-tariff barriers in order to fully harness the Uganda-Tanzania trade potential. The two countries have agreed that Uganda will supply 10,000 tonnes to cover the sugar gap in Tanzania.
