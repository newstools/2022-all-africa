State power utility Eskom has announced a further week of planned power cuts following the continued shortage of generation capacity at its power stations. The electricity supplier has been battling breakdowns and the slow return to service of some of its generation units. "While there may be instances where load shedding might need to be implemented outside of these hours, as far as possible, Eskom will endeavour to limit the implementation of load shedding to the evening peak in order to limit the impact of the capacity shortages on the public," Eskom said in a statement. This comes after recent incidents of cable theft, railway destruction, vandalism, and allegations of sabotage at Eskom. "These incidents go against the country's endeavours to move the economy in an upward trajectory, so that the triple challenge of unemployment, poverty and inequality are addressed," said Minister in the Presidency, Mondli Gungubele.
