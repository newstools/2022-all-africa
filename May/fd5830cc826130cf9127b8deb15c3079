At least 30 people lost their lives in Nigeria when a crowd waiting for food broke through the gate of the venue where a church charity event was held in Port Harcourt. Many of the casualties were children. The drive had not yet started when the stampede took place, said Grace Woyengikuro Iringe-Koko, a spokesperson for the state police. She said the crowd forced their way into the venue, despite the gate being closed. President Muhammadu Buhari said that he is "deeply saddened" by the deaths. The president said "all efforts should be made to provide relief to those injured in the unfortunate incident". Nigeria has seen similar stampedes in the past, including one at an aid agency food programme in north Borno State, where seven women were trampled to death in 2021.
