The Somali government has released U.S.$9.6 million it seized from a United Arab Emirates plane in Mogadishu four years ago, a step aimed at mending relations that have been stuck at a low point ever since.           The money was returned three days after Somali lawmakers elected a new president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, replacing Roble's political foe, Mohammed Abdullahi Mohamed. The new president has been sworn in but has not yet taken control of the government and it appears Roble acted independently.           Reliable government sources said Somali Prime Minister Mohamed Hussein Roble, leading a delegation, flew to Dubai Wednesday to deliver the money in person.           The money was seized in April 2018, when Somalia's National Intelligence and Security Agency seized three suitcases at Mogadishu's international airport from a Boeing 737/700 operated by the UAE's Royal Jet Airline.
