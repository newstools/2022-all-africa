Sifiso Meyiwa is hoping that with the murder case reopened and a trial under way, the family will finally find out who killed the Bafana Bafana footballer in 2014, writes Thathe Msimango for New Frame. It's been nearly eight years since Senzo was killed while visiting his girlfriend and the mother of his child, singer Kelly Khumalo, in Vosloorus, Gauteng. The state alleges it was a botched robbery. There were seven people in the house, yet the killer is yet to be identified. Claims have been made in several court cases about who the shooter is and what transpired on 26 October 2014. "It's painful to even express how I feel whenever I hear that this case is going to court again. Sometimes I think deep why this is happening to my brother," said Sifiso. Five men are are being tried in Pretoria for his murder, although Sifiso doesn't believe they're the killers. According to Sifiso, who is the police clerk at the Isipingo police station, his brother's death has affected his family severely. He says Senzo's murder and the authorities' failure to bring the family justice caused his father Samuel Meyiwa's death in 2019, when he had a stroke caused by stress.
