Aurore Teta Ufitiwabo for The New Times reports that 49-year-old Jean-Paul Micomyiza, who is accused of participating in the genocide against the Tutsi ethnic group in 1994 is appearing in court. Micomyiza was recently extradited from Sweden, at the request of Rwanda. The prosecution is accusing Micomyiza of various charges including murder, complicity to commit genocide, rape, causing permanent injuries, and crimes against humanity. Micomyiza was accompanied by three lawyers who immediately raised two objections and requested the suspension of the hearing. Micomyiza denied all charges, arguing that he was not part of Interahamwe - the main perpetrators of the genocide - and that he never belonged to any political party during the atrocities. The prosecution requested to remand him, arguing that he might interfere with the investigation, escape justice or threaten witnesses. The court will rule on the bail application on May 19, 2022.
