Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, the head of Guinea's military junta, has said he has opted for a 39-month transitional period before a return to civilian rule.           The announcement came after the creation of what the regime has described as an "inclusive consultation framework" in April 2022 that culminated in a conference boycotted by several prominent political groups.           Regional bloc ECOWAS had set April 25, 2022 as a deadline for putting forward an "acceptable" transition timetable or risk economic and financial sanctions.           In September 2021, army officers led by Colonel Doumbouya, ousted elected president Alpha Conde. Conde, 84, had drawn fierce opposition after he pushed through a new constitution in 2020 that allowed him to run for a third presidential term.           Guinea's coup in September 2021 followed on the heels of a military takeover in Mali.           ECOWAS has applied sanctions on members of the Mali junta, froze its assets at the Central Bank of West African States, and imposed a trade embargo.           For Guinea, leading junta members have been sanctioned and are subject to a travel ban within the bloc.
