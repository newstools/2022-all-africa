South Africa's judicial commission into state capture, known as the Zondo Commission, recently handed over the fourth part of its voluminous and scathing findings to President Cyril Ramaphosa. As a fact-finding commission, it had to determine if there were facts that were relevant for prosecutorial purposes related to "state capture" and corruption during the reign of former president Jacob Zuma, writes Dirk Kotze for The Conversation. The commission was recommended by the former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela in November 2016 to complete her "State of Capture" report. Parliament has said it is in the process of "establishing appropriate systems" which will help it to "process and oversee" the implementation of the State Capture Report. The full report is due to be handed over to the legislative body following the submission of the last tranche of the report to President Cyril Ramaphosa. The initial release of the report sent shockwaves from an 87-page examination of how former president Jacob Zuma and his accomplices captured the South African Revenue Service. The report recommended prosecution against former high-ranking lawmakers and their public and private sector affiliates. It also called for greater protection of whistleblowers and the establishment of a single, multifunctional, properly resourced and independent anti-corruption authority by the government, with a mandate to "confront the abuses inherent in the present system".
