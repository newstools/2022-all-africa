The United Nations and partners have launched two new initiatives to accelerate action towards achieving clean, affordable energy for all, and the ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions amid the global energy crisis and worsening climate emergency. The UN-Energy Plan of Action Towards 2025 delivers on commitments made at a high-level meeting in September 2021, that laid out a global roadmap for energy access and transition by the end of the decade, while also contributing to net zero emissions by 2050. The UN-Energy partnership brings together some 30 organizations working on all aspects of energy and sustainable development. An Energy Compact Action Network was also launched to match governments seeking support for their clean energy goals with governments and businesses that have already pledged over U.S.$600 billion in assistance. Coalitions to support energy access and transition in Nigeria and in Santiago, Chile, were also announced, thus showcasing the Network's potential. The commitments will drive forward achievement of a just, inclusive energy transition, aimed at ensuring all people have access to clean and affordable energy, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), reports UN News.
