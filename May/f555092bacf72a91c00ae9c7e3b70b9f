As communities in South Africa's coastal province KwaZulu-Natal continue to search for their missing loved ones after devastating floods that killed more than 400 people, the overwhelming impact of the climate crisis is again front and centre. A scheduled meeting of world environmental body the Campaign for Nature, with its Global Steering Committee (GSC) that included South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, said: "There is no doubt that what has happened here is yet another reminder that we must do something fast." The deadly floods that racked KwaZulu-Natal and parts of the Eastern Cape led to a declaration of a national disaster by Ramaphosa after an assessment of the damage was made by the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and other government representatives. "These floods are the worst floods that we have ever seen in living memory. The impact of these floods are well beyond the province," Dlamini-Zuma said. Dhesigen Naidoo for ISS (Institute for Security Studies) wrote that governments suffer from "lethargy ... in reducing the global carbon budget" and the latest floods in South Africa "are the latest in a series of environmental disasters on the continent in the past few months, and the need for smart early-warning systems and the climate-proofing of South Africa's infrastructure".
