In 26 years, Nigeria's textile sector has lost over 117,000 jobs. According to the Textile Association of Nigeria, the sector could lose more jobs if the government does not intervene urgently to salvage the ailing industry.  The association's Folorunsho Daniyan added that the promised benefits of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement would elude Nigeria, if the illegal import of textile fabrics and other products Nigeria can produce locally, continue to find their way into its markets unchecked, writes Gilbert Ekugbe for This Day.
