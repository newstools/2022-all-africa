Shake the Table is a non-profit bridging philanthropy and social justice movements that together with an advisory firm, The Bridgespan Group joined forces to examine how to better connect global philanthropy with feminist movements in their report Lighting the Way: A Report for Philanthropy on the Power and Promise of Feminist Movements. The report calls on the philanthropic community to invest an additional U.S.$6 billion by 2026 to "hold ground against the anti-gender movement and gain traction in shifting power." To shed more light on this matter, AllAfrica's Melody Chironda spoke with renowned women's rights and social justice activist Theo Sowa about women's rights and democracy.
