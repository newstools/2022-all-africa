The Lagos High Court has sentenced a Danish national, Peter Nielsen to death by hanging, for the murder of his Nigerian wife, Zainab, and their daughter in 2018. Rights activists, who have protested the murder, praised the court's ruling. The judge said that evidence from an autopsy revealed that Zainab and daughter died of head injuries and suffocation. The autopsy report also stated that Zainab's fingertips showed she had struggled to free herself from her killer's grip, and that traces of DNA found on her skin were consistent with Nielsen's. The deaths triggered criticism from women's rights groups. According to the World Health Organisation, violence against women - particularly intimate partner violence and sexual violence - is a major public health problem and a violation of women's human rights.  Estimates published by WHO indicate that globally, about one in three (33%) women worldwide have experienced either physical and or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime. The recent death of one of Nigeria's leading gospel music artist, Osinachi Nwachukwu, who was allegedly battered to death by her husband, has elicited a nationwide outcry. Christian leaders have since risen in outright condemnation, with many calling for her husband to face the hangman. Her death, however, revealed the scary statistics of women who are subjected to inhumane and violent treatment at the hands of their spouses.
