Nokuthula Mabaso, a leader in a shack-dwellers' movement in Durban in KwaZulu-Natal province, is the latest victim in a series of suspected assassinations of figures opposed to the State at local and national level. "In political terms," says an editorial in New Frame, "the city is now not unlike many cities in Central America. Politics has been criminalised and violence routinised. To stand for even the most modest demands, if you are an impoverished person - a person considered to be fungible - is to put your life at risk." The editorial attributes the city's political crisis to the ruling African National Congress, which it describes as "systemically rotten" and "systemically violent."
