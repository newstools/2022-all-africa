While there has been significant social, legal, and political progress in many African countries with regards to the free expression of sexual orientation and gender identity in recent times, discrimination, physical and psychological violence is still pervasive - even in decriminalised contexts. Scholars and activists in different fields concerned with Queer- and LGBTIQ+ studies have been identifying gaps in the political, legal, and social environments, and proposing new models for deepening the recognition and acceptance of queer identities in Africa. To address these issues, the Centre for Human Rights (CHR) and the Centre for Sexualities, AIDS, and Gender at the University Pretoria together with the Center for Gender Studies and Feminist Futures and the Center for Conflict Studies at the Philipps-University Marburg have launched the first edition of the Pretoria-Marburg Queer Conversations which will be held monthly from April to September 2022.
