United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged the military juntas in Burkina Faso, Guinea and Mali to hand power back to civilian rule as soon as possible. He also reminded the world to deliver on "climate emergency" promises.           All three countries, struggling with a jihadist insurgency in the Sahel region, have recently experienced military coups: Mali in August 2020 and May 2021; Guinea in September 2021; and Burkina Faso in January 2022.           Speaking after meeting Senegalese President Macky Sall in Dakar on May 1, 2022 Guterres said they had agreed on the need to keep talking to the de facto authorities in all three countries so as to get a swift return to "constitutional order".           The number of militia attacks in the Sahel region of Africa "continues to increase" according to the UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who arrived in the capital of Niger, Niamey, on May 2, the second of three countries he is visiting on a tour of West Africa, to mark the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
