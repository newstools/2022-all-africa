The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued an emergency use listing (EUL) for CONVIDECIA™, a vaccine manufactured by CanSino Biologics, China, adding to a growing portfolio of vaccines validated by WHO for the prevention of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. The emergency use listing (EUL) procedure assesses the suitability of novel health products during public health emergencies. The objective is to make medicines, vaccines and diagnostics available as rapidly as possible to address the emergency while adhering to stringent criteria of safety, efficacy and quality. The assessment weighs the threat posed by the emergency as well as the benefit that would accrue from the use of the product against any potential risks. As of May 20, 2022, confirmed cases of Covid-19 from 55 African countries reached 11,662,928 while over 298,026,398 vaccinations have been administered across the continent.
