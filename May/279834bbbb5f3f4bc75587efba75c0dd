Sudan on May 29, 2022, lifted the state of emergency that the military imposed after seizing control in a coup in October 2021.           The Transitional Sovereign Council said in a statement said it issued a decree order to create an atmosphere for "a fruitful and meaningful dialogue that achieves stability during the transitional period".           Since the coup, at least 98 people were killed and over 4,300 wounded in a crackdown on anti-coup protesters, according to the medical group Committee of Sudan Doctors (CCSD). Already one of the world's poorest countries, Sudan has also faced international aid cuts and economic turmoil since the coup.           When the military took over on October 25, 2021 it upended a transition to civilian rule after the 2019 ouster of autocratic president Omar al-Bashir, who ruled the country for three decades. The military insists it will only step down once an elected government is in place and has proposed elections for July 2023.
