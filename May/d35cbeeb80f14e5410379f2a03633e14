Former President Goodluck Jonathan has rejected a presidential nomination form bought for him by a group from northern Nigeria.  Jonathan's Media Adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, said in a statement that the group had bought the form and that the former president did not authorize the purchase and considered the move by the group 'an insult'. "We wish to categorically state that Dr Jonathan was not aware of this bid and did not authorize it," the statement read in part. The form was for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) that defeated Jonathan who governed Nigeria on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party before losing his re-election bid to Muhammadu Buhari in 2015. Nigeria's main political parties are expected to hold their primaries later this month to meet the election commission's dateline of 3 June for the submission of their candidates for the February 2023 election.
