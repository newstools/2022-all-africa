South Sudan's transitional government is due to wrap up in less than 10 months. Yet the country's future looks as bleak as it did in 2018,  when rival parties signed a deal to end a crippling civil war that killed nearly 400,000 people.           Some 75% of the population are in need of assistance. Hunger is the worst it has been since the country gained independence in 2011, and years of unprecedented floods have forced nearly one million people from their homes, according to the UN.           The Panel of Experts on South Sudan, a UN-mandated investigative group, reported in April 2022 that almost every component of the peace agreement is now hostage to the political calculations of the country's military and security elites, who use a combination of violence, misappropriated public resources and patronage, to pursue their own narrow interests.           Civil society leaders, religious leaders, and the international community are becoming exasperated at the listless peace deal and the increase in violence.           According to the 2018 power-sharing agreement, the transitional government - which officially ends next February - culminates in elections in December 2022. Yet this is unlikely to happen on time, and there is concern that if elections did take place things could get worse, writes Sam Mednick for New Humanitarian.
