President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered all his ministers who wish to contest the next year's election to resign by May 16. The move could have an impact on the running of government given the high number of ministers likely to be affected by the decision. Several ministers have already declared their intentions to be their party's candidates in either presidential or gubernatorial elections. Nigeria's main political parties are expected to hold their primaries later this month to meet the election commission's dateline of 3 June for the submission of their candidates for the February 2023 election. However, the directive does not affect the president's deputy Yemi Osinbajo - who is seeking the presidential ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress party - as he is an elected official and not appointed.
