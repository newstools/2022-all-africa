Zanzibar's Deputy Minister for Education and Vocational Training Ali Hussein has said a report will be submitted to the ministry responsible for public service for the employment of the required teachers. Hussein revealed there is a shortage of science teachers especially in Unguja and Pemba areas. Hussein said that the deficit includes a shortage of 259 physics teachers; 74 chemistry teachers; 53 biology teachers, and 430 mathematics teachers. The department blames poor performance of schools in Unguja and Pemba to lack of skilled teachers particularly in science subjects.
