The number of prisoners executed in sub-Saharan Africa more than doubled in 2021, largely a result of death sentences passed on al-Shabaab militants in Somalia, reports Amnesty International.           But while the number of those either sentenced or actually put to death during the year rose, most countries which have not yet abolished the death penalty did not carry out any executions. Prisoners were executed in only three of 28 nations surveyed. Thousands of prisoners still sit on death rows around the continent, most of them in Nigeria. In some countries, no one has been executed for up to 30 years. In 2021, several countries deployed the death penalty as a clear instrument of state repression against minorities and protesters. In Egypt, the authorities used torture and mass executions, often following unfair trials before Emergency State Security Courts.
