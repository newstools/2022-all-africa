Farmers in Umguza and Bubi farming areas in Matebeleland North province are struggling to contain a massive outbreak of quelea birds which are feasting on their crops, mainly small grains. Quelea birds, whose population is estimated to be 1,8 billion in 25 countries, cause extensive damage to cereal grains, especially wheat, rice, barely, sorghum and millets when they reach the ripening stage. Breeding occurs entirely outside the Highveld region and natural reserves starting in January each year after sufficient rains and move in large numbers.
