Abdul Abiola, one of the sons of the late Chief MKO Abiola has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to investigate the circumstances that led to the death of his father. He asked that Buhari look into Nigeria's archives to reveal the truth, adding that it is time for Nigerians to know what led to the death of his father. Abiola was the presumed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential elections but the result was annulled by the former head of state, General Ibrahim Babangida. Abiola died under suspicious circumstances on July 7, 1998 while in detention.  The June 12, 1993 election is still considered one of the fairest in Nigerian history.
