Nigerian police has confirmed the arrest of two suspects alleged to be involved in the kidnapping of more than 130 learners at Bethel Baptist High School and students from Greenfield University. They are among 31 suspects connected with major violent crimes, including kidnapping, culpable homicide, rape, and the unlawful possession of firearms, among others. 140 students of Bethel Baptist High School were kidnapped in July 2021, while 16 students of Greenfield University were also kidnapped in May 2021. Five of them were killed while some were released after families paid the ransom. Kidnapping remains a major security challenge in Nigeria, with hundreds of learners taken since December 2020. Most have been released after ransom negotiations. Parents and family members of kidnapped schoolchildren have been at loggerheads with the government on ransom payments to free their loved ones. The government remains opposed, saying that it makes the kidnappers more powerful.
