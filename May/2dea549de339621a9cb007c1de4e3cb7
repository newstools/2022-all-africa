The department of home affairs has dismissed, with immediate effect, the chief director who recommended that self-proclaimed prophet Shepherd Bushiri and his family be issued with permanent residence permits. In their statement, the department said the Bushiri family were issued with permanent residence they did not deserve. Chief Director for Permitting Ronney Marhule was found guilty on two counts of misconduct relating to dishonesty and negligence at the conclusion of a lengthy disciplinary hearing which lasted for almost a year. The department said that this comes after Marhule tried in vain to stop the disciplinary process on at least three occasions at the Labour Court and at the Labour Appeal Court. Bushiri and his wife Mary have been fugitives from justice in South Africa since 2020. The pair appeared in court on charges of among others, money laundering to the tune of U.S.$ 6 million (R100 million). The pair skipped bail with a little help, allegedly from a corrupt South African police official and her husband, fleeing to their home country, Malawi. They then set conditions for their return to South Africa, including a request that their bail conditions not be revoked, as they fled "fearing for their lives". While their arrest in Malawi was deemed "unlawful", the pair, who are leaders of the Enlightened Christian Gathering church, continue with a new venture, a face-to-face meeting with Shepherd Bushiri at a cost of U.S.$467,00 (R7,000) per person in a Crossing Over event to be held in Malawi from January 1 to 4, 2021.
