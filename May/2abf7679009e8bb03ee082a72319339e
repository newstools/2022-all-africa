Shopping for food in Nigeria's largest cities can be a challenge. After battling the notorious traffic of Lagos or Abuja to reach open-air markets, many shoppers are frustrated to find that the foods on offer are very expensive and that prices are rising all the time. The Nigerian tech startup Pricepally  offers another option. It connects customers in two of Nigeria's largest cities with farm-fresh food at lower prices, delivered to their homes within a day or two. allAfrica's Nontobeko Mlambo spoke with Pricepally Co-Founder Monsunmola Lawoyin and COO Jummai Abalaka about their plan to make fresh food available to the whole continent.
