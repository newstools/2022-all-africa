The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission is investigating a video shared online that appears to show government troops abusing and shooting an ethnic Tigrayan boy.           In the video, the boy, with blood on his face, is seen sitting while the men in uniform surround him and threaten him with death. One of the men in uniforms calls for the boy to suffer rather than being killed immediately. They tell a teenage girl to forcefully feed the boy. Finally, one man steps forward and shoots the boy, and the video ends.            Rights group Amnesty International has verified the killing of 11 civilians in that incident. Forces from the rebel Tigray People's Liberation Front also have been accused of committing human rights violations. In February 2022, Amnesty International reported that TPLF forces and their affiliates have killed more than a dozen people and gang raped women in towns of the Amhara region they occupied.
