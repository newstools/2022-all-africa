Trade unions Nehawu and the Public Servants Association of South Africa (PSA) have slammed a 1.4% offer by the South African Revenue Service (SARS) with the organisations calling for a 7% increase instead, among other benefits. SARS, who urged affected members of the public to utilise its website rather than visiting its offices due to the strike, claimed there was difficulty in according salary increases for its workers due to the financial challenges facing the country. SARS Commissioner Edward Kieswetter said he understood and empathised with the financial challenges faced by SARS employees and the general public. "In fact, all South Africans, especially millions who are unemployed, suffer the impact of the current economic climate. SARS is a microcosm of the broader society and the sentiment of discontent is understandable, especially when they have a sense that the current situation is unlikely to change in the short term. "Employees do not willingly withhold their labour because that in itself has a financial impact on them under already tough times. One has to understand though, that when workers feel frustrated they feel that by going on strike is the last resort for them to be heard," Kieswetter said.
