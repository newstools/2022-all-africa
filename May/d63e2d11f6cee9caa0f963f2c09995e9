South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has said the country is poised to take advantage of the growing demand for platinum group metals, as Western sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine have forced mining investors to look to Africa.           Ramaphosa's comments came this week at the Investing in African Mining Conference in Cape Town. Mining analyst Peter Major said while it's unfortunate to say, the war in Ukraine is helping South Africa's economy.           "We produce half of the world's palladium and we produce 75% of the world's platinum and we produce about 90% of the world's rhodium," Major said. "Because the world is restricting the platinum and palladium they get from Russia, it's squeezing the price up so we're in a great position."           South Africa is also a major coal producer, and Major notes coal prices are on the rise. "We were lucky to get $100 a ton for our coal, now we're getting $300 a ton," he said. "And we're only exporting coal as much as we did in 1994 because our infrastructure is so bad. But at least we're getting three times the price than we would've been getting."
