Wendy Wangui for Capital FM reports that the Pharmaceutical Society of Kenya is calling for strict guidelines to be put in place to prevent the misuse of prescription drugs including the so called 'Mchele' which can be easily obtained over the counter. According to the society's Chief Executive Officer, Lucas Nyabero, a lack of proper measures to regulate the sector has led to Kenyans obtaining dangerous drugs which are often used to harm others. He urged Kenyans to acquire their medication from licensed and registered pharmacies to avoid falling victim to unscrupulous dealers. He expressed concern over what he termed, the rise of cases of people being drugged and robbed through spiking of drinks in nightclubs. He said that 'Mchele' is a prescription drug used to treat severe insomnia and assists in anesthesia but is being used in criminal activities. The slang 'Mchele' in reference to the drug is used because of its resemblance to grains of rice.
