On March 23, 2022 the US Senate's Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved a draft resolution condemning the military coup in Sudan and calling on the U.S. administration to impose sanctions on those responsible.  The Treasury listed the excessively violent repression of peaceful pro-democracy protests by the security forces as the main reason.      On May 11, 2022 the U.S. Senate passed a draft resolution condemning the coup and affirming its support for the Sudanese people. The lower house also unanimously passed the resolution without any objections.           Earlier this week, a diverse group of 108 international and Sudanese organisations and human rights defenders signed an open letter to the White House in Washington, urging the U.S. administration to impose targeted sanctions on Chairperson of Sudan's Sovereignty Council General Abdelfattah El Burhan and Deputy Chairperson Mohamed Dagalo 'Hemeti' for their involvement in serious human rights abuses following the military coup they led on October 25, 2021.
