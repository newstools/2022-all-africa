At the 75th World Health Assembly, Member States have agreed to adopt a landmark decision to improve the World Health Organization's (WHO) financing model, according to a WHO statement. WHO's current financing model has been identified by many experts as posing a risk to the integrity and independence of its work. WHO's over-reliance on voluntary contributions, with a large proportion earmarked for specific areas of work, results in an ongoing misalignment between organizational priorities and the ability to finance them. The latest recommendations are designed to substantially address these shortcomings. Additionally, an open letter from 80 global organizations to delegates attending the World Health Assembly called on Member States to adopt a sustainbale finaning model. "The world needs a strong, sustainably financed WHO. In turn, Member States deserve the assurance that theorganization is transparent, efficient, and accountable for its financial and programmatic performance, which the Director-General has committed to advance," the letter read.
