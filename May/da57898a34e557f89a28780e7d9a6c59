Peace Direct's new report titled Peace, Race and Power explores how racism manifests itself within peacebuilding sectors. The report that was compiled through global consultations which included over 160 people from 70 countries highlights the need to decolonise peace processes. The report found that the peacebuilding sector continues to sideline local peacebuilders who are most affected by and most proximate to conflicts. It also highlights different forms that racism takes in peacebuilding processes including an assumption that Global North actors can 'fix' the problem in other countries, and funding mechanisms that are not transparent and inaccessible to most Global South actors. One of the report's recommendations is that players from the Global North should consider that their knowledge may not be the most relevant.
