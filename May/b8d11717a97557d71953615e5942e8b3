Blood Sisters is a thriller series that narrates the journey of two best friends, Sarah and Kemi, who become fugitives after murdering a man, Kola. They find themselves running away from the law and the ruthless family of their victim. The Nigerian series raises important social issues that include gender-based violence, favoritism of parents between their children, real friendship, domestic violence, toxic parenting, and drug abuse. Blood Sisters is meant to entertain. However, let us not forget that entertainment can be a vehicle that amplifies important social issues, writes Dr. Ifeanyi M. Nsofor.
