Kanyali Muthui for The Exchange reports that American social media giant Meta, formerly Facebook - has now distanced itself from claims that its main subcontractor for content moderation in Africa - Sama - allegedly violated a number of employee rights in its Kenyan hub. This comes after a law firm threatened to sue Meta and Sama over the alleged unsafe and unfair work conditions imposed on its content moderators. Advocates from Nzili and Sumbi law firm, allege that Sama had breached a number of rights including the health and privacy of its Kenyan and international staff. The law firm demanded that both Meta and Sama adhere to Kenya's labour, privacy and health laws, including that it provides its content moderators with adequate mental health insurance and better compensation. Additionally, the law firm demanded that the two firms recruit qualified and experienced health professionals for the content moderators. For a lot of social media platforms, content moderators perform the brutal task of viewing and removing illegal or banned content from these sites before any of it is seen by the average user. Following the exposé, Sama denied any wrongdoing, saying it is transparent during its hiring process and has a culture that "prioritises employee health and wellness."
