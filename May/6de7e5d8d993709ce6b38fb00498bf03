Pete Howson for Thomson Reuters Foundation reports that the Central African Republic (CAR) has become the latest country to adopt bitcoin as a national currency. The move follows 2021's adoption by El Salvador. But CAR's sudden embrace of crypto is confusing. El Salvador's bitcoin adoption isn't going well. Besides warnings by the International Monetary Fund and fears of default, a recent survey found 86% of Salvadoran businesses have never carried out a bitcoin transaction. CAR, the world's second-poorest country, is nowhere near ready for crypto payments. Yet CAR's authorities threaten significant fines and other penalties on vendors who refuse to accept bitcoin for payments. Elsewhere on the continent, despite reported crimes against humanity by paramilitaries in Ethiopia, developers of the Cardano cryptocurrency are working with Ethiopian authorities to build digital-surveillance systems, including a digital ID and records system. Cardano hopes to roll out an Ethiopia-wide crypto-payment network, before connecting the entire African continent. Much of Africa is rich in precious resources. In colonial times, to profit from these resources, European powers and their private companies capitalised on conflict. The term "blood diamond" became well-known, defined as any diamond sold to fund military action in diamond-rich areas of Africa.
