Senegal, which currently chairs the African Union, is co-hosting Thursday's virtual second Global COVID-19 Summit, joining the host of the first summit last September, the United States, along with Belize, as CARICOM Chair and Germany and Indonesia, which are current holders of the G7 and G20 Presidencies respectively. Other countries listed as participating include South Africa, Nigeria, Tanzania and Rwanda. The goal is to intensify the global response to the pandemic and increase vaccinations across the globe, protect the most vulnerable populations and "prevent futures catastrophes," according to the White House media advisory. The Summit provides a critical opportunity for firm commitments to combat the pandemic, according to a statement issued by Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator established by the World Health Organization and partners. "It is imperative that leaders seize this opportunity to mobilize the funding and political will required to achieve global targets for COVID-19 vaccination coverage, testing rates and access to treatments, including oral antivirals and oxygen," the leaders said.
