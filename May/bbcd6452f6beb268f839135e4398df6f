Susan Nyawira for Capital FM reports that motorists can now use the Nairobi Expressway toll road that cuts through the city from Westlands to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA). The 27.1kilometre starts from Mlolongo passing through JKIA and Nairobi's CBD to the James Gichuru junction along Waiyaki Way. The road was commissioned for trials on May 14, 2022 by Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia. Macharia said so far, 11,000 vehicles had been registered to use the expressway, in an exercise undertaken by Moja Expressway, the company managing the new road. Motorists using the Nairobi Expressway will be required to drive at a speed of 80km/h. Making U-turns and reversing is prohibited on the expressway, with motorists who miss the planned exit required to proceed to the next toll station to leave. Moja Expressway, a subsidiary of China Road and Bridge Corporation, will manage the expressway for 27 years, to recoup the money spent on construction, through toll fees. The expressway is expected to increase local employment, ease traffic jams, and bring a raft of economic benefits to the notoriously congested city.
