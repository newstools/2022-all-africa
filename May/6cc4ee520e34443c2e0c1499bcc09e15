Local officials and security sources have said that Al-Shabaab fighters stormed an African Union military base in the village of El-Baraf in Somalia's Middle Shabelle region on May 3, 2022. The Mayor of El-Baraf, Abdullahi Haji Muhumed, said the militants started their attack with two suicide truck bombs, followed by them entering the base.           The incident marked the first major Al-Shabaab attack on AU forces since the mission changed its name and operational structures last month. The raid sparked a fierce battle between Burundi troops and Al-Shabaab militants.           Local people have said that the Somali government forces participated in the battle on the outskirts of Mahaday district, supporting the AU troops who came under Al-Shabaab attack.                .
