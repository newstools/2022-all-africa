Former president, Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo, has handed over power to his successor Hassan Sheikh Mohamud who was elected as the 10th president in May 15, 2022 elections in Mogadishu.           As he settles into office, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud faces a politically divided nation, huge public expectations and the specter of Al-Shabaab, a militant group which has remained a potent threat since it emerged in 2007.           Fawzia Yusuf, a former deputy prime minister who ran for president in the just concluded elections, said the new president has the uphill task of constituting a competent government given the many competing interests.           In the coming days, the president is expected to name a new prime minister who will need parliamentary approval before proceeding to name a Cabinet.           According to Abdurahman Sheikh Azhari, the director of the Mogadishu-based Center for Analysis and Strategic Studies, the new president, like his predecessor, doesn't have much leeway in dealing with Al-Shabaab.           Farmajo served as 9th president from 2017 to 2022 after a year of delay in the elections due to the political crisis in the country.
