Civil servants under the Zimbabwe Confederation of Public Sector Trade Unions (ZCPSTU) are set to march against government's continued reluctance to pay them in U.S. dollars. Worries eminating from biting inflation and their devalued salaries have been ignored by government, according to ZCPSTU. In a statement, ZCPSTU organising secretary Charles Chinosengwa, said that Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube, the labour ministry and parliament's labour committee will be petitioned on May 27, 2022 as civil engagements had failed to yield any positive result. Government workers have been demanding reinstatement of their U.S.$540 wage after it was scrapped by Ncube in October 2018, replacing it with Zimbabwe dollars which has continuously lost value.
