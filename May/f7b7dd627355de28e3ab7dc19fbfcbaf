Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has banned the operations of commercial motorcycles popularly called Okada, in six local governments -  Ikeja, Surulere, Eti-Osa, Lagos Mainland, Lagos Island, and Apapa. Sanwo-Olu said the ban - the second in just over two years - would come into effect from June 1, 2022.  Traffic jams are part of daily life in Lagos, where many residents use motorcycles to criss-cross between the traffic, but with little regard for road and safety rules. "Lives are being lost on a daily basis, preventable accidents are happening every day and the riders are not respecting any of our traffic laws," Sanwo-Olu said. The governor said that motorcycle taxi services in Lagos were unsafe.
