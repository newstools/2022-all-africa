As the joint investigation between Namibian and Angolan police regarding the firearms that were smuggled into Angola continues, it was discovered that some of the accused in the case allegedly involves prominent Angolan nationals. This was revealed by Inspector General Sebastian Ndeitunga of the Namibian Police during his visit to the Angolan-Namibian borders.           Ndeitunga further added they have arrested several police and immigration officials who were involved in illegal activities. The illicit weapons trade in small arms has been at least partially blamed for the persistence of wars across the African continent.
