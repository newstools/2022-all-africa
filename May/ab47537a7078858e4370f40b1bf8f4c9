Earlier in May, 2022 - after a false start at the end of April, 2022 - representatives of some 23 of the eastern DRC's countless armed rebel groups concluded five days of negotiations with the government in Nairobi. This was to discuss the terms and conditions of their laying down of arms.           The peace talks, under the aegis of Kenya, were backed up by a threat of force against those who didn't surrender. At an EAC (East African Community) summit days before, the presidents of Kenya, the DR Congo, Burundi and Uganda, and Rwanda's Foreign Minister Vincent Biruta, resolved to form an EAC intervention force to track down groups who are continuing to fight.           Officials didn't release a list of militia groups who were invited, or of those who had participated, but unofficial lists circulating suggest that most of the main groups were absent.           According to local media reports, the invitation was extended only to local DR Congo groups, while foreign groups had been warned to go home or face elimination by the proposed EAC force.           The new peace initiative seems to be the outcome of the DR Congo joining the EAC earlier in April, 2022.
