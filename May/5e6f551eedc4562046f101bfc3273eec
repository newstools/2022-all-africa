The Consumers Federation of Kenya has raised an alarm that many supermarkets are still selling popular Indomie products despite reports that it contains high aflatoxins and pesticide residues which are harmful for human consumption. The Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) earlier urged its member states, including Kenya, to stop the importation of the products after Egypt banned the chicken and vegetable flavoured instant noodles and the instant noodles with chilli packs. Food safety tests conducted by the Food Safety Authority of Egypt found that the two variants contained aflatoxins and pesticide residues in quantities that exceeded safe limits, reports Carolyne Tanui for Capital FM. The Rwanda Food and Drug Authority has also started an inspection into the chicken flavoured product, after imports were stopped.
