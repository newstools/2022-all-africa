Nine years after a coup plunged the country into chaos and led to the Central African Armed Forces' (FACA, or Forces armées centrafricaines) dissolution, the military has re-established a presence in every major urban centre of the Central African Republic.           The benefits of this redeployment could however be compromised by the army's opaque recruitment procedures, multiple chains of command, lack of training and poor budget management.           Ethnic polarisation in the rank and file and nepotism on the part of heads of state in Bangui, have long hindered the creation of an army capable of securing the country. Successive governments have nonetheless undertaken numerous reforms since the mutinies of the 1990s.           Five years after the launch of the National Defence Plan, the army seems once again to be falling into politicisation. The number of new troops has greatly surpassed the plan's projected increase and background checks of new recruits are no longer taking place.           The country is at a turning point in its stabilisation process after the electoral crisis of December 2020. If these issues are not addressed quickly, they could undermine soldiers' loyalty to the state and push them to rise up or join a new rebellion writes Enrica Picco for International Crisis Group.
