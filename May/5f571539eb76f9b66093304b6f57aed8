A group of families have camped outside the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) offices in Pretoria, South Africa for more than a week. The people  from DR Congo and Burundi who were housed at the Lindela Repatriation Centre for over three years, are calling to be repatriated to any country - a demand the UNHCR said is "unrealistic". Speaking to GroundUp, families say they will continue to sleep outside the UNHCR offices, despite the cold. Many of them want to be taken to a country where they will be safe from xenophobia. They currently refuse to return to homes and claim that conditions at the Lindela Repatriation Centre in Krugersdorp - a city in Gauteng province - were poor, as electricity was cut off and that they were denied medical treatment at a clinic inside the centre. The group's actions mirror those of other people who during 2019, also camped in front of the UNHCR's offices in Cape Town, staging a sit-in at the agency's offices before their violent removal by police.
