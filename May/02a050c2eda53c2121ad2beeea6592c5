Africa feels the impacts of COVID-19, conflict, and climate change perhaps more than any other region in the world. The costs of food, fuel, and fertilizer have skyrocketed over the past several months, adding to the slowdown in economic growth that the pandemic instigated.

Unlocking the potential of the bioeconomy could help drive the next phase of Africa's economic development all while better conserving the environment and tackling climate change, as a new report by the Malabo Montpellier Panel explains, write Dr. Ousmane Badiane and Prof. Joachim von Braun.
