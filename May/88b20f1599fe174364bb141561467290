Ghana and Uganda are among a slew of African countries banning the export of grains and other farm produce with the latter imposing high taxes to prevent food exports to neighbouring countries, reports Isaac Mugabi for Deutsche Welle. The Ghanaian government has extended a ban on grain exports - initally a temporary ban on exporting maize, rice, soybeans, and other grain. The ban which took effect in September 2021, will now run until September 2022. The original ban was put in place to ensure food security and increase local poultry and livestock production. The ban extension comes as grain prices soar, partly due to the war between Russia and the Ukraine. Some farmers have expressed their unhappiness with the extension, saying they would get better prices if they sell their crops outside of Ghana. The Ugandan government in turn is imposing high taxes on food products like maize, soybeans, rice, and wheat to prevent traders from selling their products outside of the country.
