The world marks World No Tobacco Day on May 31 every year, to raise awareness of the negative health, social, economic, and environmental impacts of tobacco production and use. This year's theme, "Tobacco: Threat to Our Environment", aims to highlight the environmental impact of the entire tobacco cycle, from cultivation, production, and distribution to the toxic waste it generates. A WHO report highlights that the industry's carbon footprint from production, processing, and transporting tobacco is equivalent to one-fifth of the CO2 produced by the commercial airline industry each year, further contributing to global warming. Tobacco use still poses significant health, economic and social burden worldwide. In fact, some countries - mostly in Africa - are experiencing increases in smoking prevalence. The latest Tobacco Atlas shows that, globally, 1.13 billion people were current smokers in 2019. And 8.67 million deaths were attributable to tobacco smoking, writes Sam Filby for The Conversation. According to WHO, despite 24 African countries instituting bans on smoking in public places, and 35 banning tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship - estimates are that one in every 10 African adolescents use tobacco. The emergence of new products, such as electronic nicotine and tobacco products, is also proving attractive to youths -compounding the concerns.
