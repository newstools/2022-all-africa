The military has said civilians buried scores of separatist fighters in mass graves after troops launched raids on rebel strongholds in the country's North West regions. A separatist spokesman accused Cameroon's military of executing their captured fighters, which the military denies.           Cameroonian authorities blamed anglophone separatists for kidnappings, ransoms, disrupting traffic and attacks on public buildings controlled by the central government in Yaounde.           A video widely shared on social media showed the digging a mass grave in Guzang, a village in Cameroon's English-speaking North-West region. The people in the video say seven of the corpses they were burying were separatist fighters and one civilian.           Separatists in English-speaking western Cameroon launched their rebellion in 2017 after what they said was years of discrimination by the country's French-speaking majority. The conflict has killed more than 3,300 people and displaced more than a half million according to the United Nations.
