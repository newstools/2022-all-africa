Five ex-senior Transnet officials, including former chief executive Siyabonga Gama, have been arrested on charges of money laundering, corruption and fraud. This comes after the Investigative Directorate (ID) who, in collaboration with special police unit the Hawks, confirmed the suspects' arrest. In Part 2 of his State Capture report on how Transnet became the principal site of looting by the Gupta enterprise, Chief Justice Raymond Zondo described Gama, along fellow former chief executive Brian Molefe and former chief financial officer Anoj Singh as the "primary architects" of State Capture at the rail, port and pipeline company.
