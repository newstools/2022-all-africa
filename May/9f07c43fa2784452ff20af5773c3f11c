The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in Nigeria has said that they have arrested the country's accountant-general, Ahmed Idris, on suspicion he diverted almost U.S.$200 million of public funds. According to the anti-graft agency, intelligence showed that the Idris raked off the funds through bogus consultancies and other illegal activities using proxies, family members, and close associates. The funds were also reportedly laundered through real estate investments in Kano and Abuja. President Muhammed Buhari appointed Idris accountant-general on June 25, 2015. The president reappointed Idris for a second four-year term in June 2019 despite attaining the retirement age of 60. Nigeria has struggled with corruption for many years, but the EFCC has successfully prosecuted politicians, police officers, and civil servants. Last year it recovered around U.S.$750 million in assets.
