Nigeria's main opposition, the People's Democratic Party, has picked former vice president Atiku Abubakar as its candidate for the 2023 presidential elections.This will be the 75-year-old's sixth shot at the presidency. Abubakar lost to incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari in 2019 in the last election, which he claimed was rigged. The PDP governed Nigeria for a decade and a half before its then-president Goodluck Jonathan was ousted by the All Progressives Congress in 2015, that saw Buhari take office.  The next Nigerian president will need to grapple with persistent inflation, slow growth, and high unemployment as the country struggles to recover from its worse recession in four decades in 2020. Bandits and Islamic insurgents also continue to pose a deadly threat.
