Capital FM reports that teenage pregnancies and child labor have been identified as major impediments to the government's 100% secondary school transition programme in Kisumu County. Over 10, 000 children spread across the seven sub-counties were yet to report raising concerns amongst stakeholders. Kisumu County Director of Education Peter Munene said out of the 31, 303 candidates who sat for the 2021 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education in the area, only 20, 804 have reported so far. He attributed the poor turnout to rising cases of child labour where some of the children have ventured into boda boda (motorcycle taxi) business and other income generating activities to fend for themselves and their siblings. Cases of teenage pregnancies which skyrocketed during the Covid-19 lockdown period, he added, have also affected the turnout for girls in the area.
