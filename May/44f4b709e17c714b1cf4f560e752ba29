Although locally produced drums are an integral part of music of various ethnic groups in Cameroon, this traditionally handmade instrument is falling into disuse as modern instruments take its place, reports Radio France Internationale. "Our forefathers understood the need for these musical languages even before the white man came with guitars and the other instruments," says Mola Mongombe Na Liomo Ngaka, a musician who plays modern Njoku jazz. Craftsmen such as George Tifungton, also known as Pa Drummer, have worked with clients for years and he's been in the business for nearly three decades. Nothing beats a handmade drum, he says. "I fabricate all types, such as the Bamelike drums, Bayangi drums, Younde drums, and Bamenda drums. You don't depend only on one type of drum," he says.  Pa Drummer trains his sons in the craft, passing on his important drum-making skills. Testing the drums is also very important, as he says they "speak" in different tones, according to their size.
