As the world commemorates International Day of Action for Women's Health on May 28, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) would like to highlight the role that women peer educators play in leading community engagement for adolescent sexual reproductive health (SRH) in the suburb of Mbare and the town of Epworth in Zimbabwe. Tanatswa (20) is a vibrant peer educator for MSF. She is a core member of its SRH project in the high-density suburb in Harare, where she was raised. Mbare has high poverty levels, overcrowding, and a high rate of drug abuse among adolescents and young people. This environment predisposes them to risky sexual behaviour that fuels the spread of sexually transmitted infections. Through the peer-led approach, the SRH project has reached out to communities to ensure awareness, among others, menstrual hygiene, as well as HIV self-testing.
