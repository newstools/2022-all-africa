The 2022 State of the World Population Report has revealed that about 60% of unintended pregnancies in Lesotho end in abortion. The report further indicates that despite efforts by the government and development partners to promote Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights, unintended pregnancies continue to rise. It further showed that 35, 71% of adolescents aged between 10 to 15 years were admitted to health centres for obstetric and gynaecological attention due to abortion in 2019.           This has ignited a fierce debate in Lesotho with arguments in favour and against the banning of abortion. In the wake of the report, the Lesotho Times took to the streets of Maseru to find out the public's views on whether or not the government should be considering legalizing abortion, given that the practice happens nonetheless with hazardous consequences.
