Endemic poverty makes Malawi easy pickings for traffickers. The pandemic and fallout from Russia's war on Ukraine has exacerbated the situation despite government efforts to curb human trafficking, Kate Hairsine writes for Deutsche Welle. Malawi has long been a trafficking hotspot in southern Africa and one major driver for this is endemic poverty and extensive rural unemployment. It is one of the poorest countries in the world, ranking 174 out of 189 countries on the United Nations' Human Development Index. Half of the population lives below the national poverty line and a quarter lives in extreme poverty.
