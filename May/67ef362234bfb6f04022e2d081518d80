The rift between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto has re-emerged again at the national prayer breakfast after the two leaders - who always shared a table at similar events in the past - broke with the tradition. During the event, traditionally held at the Safari Park Hotel in Nairobi, the president and his deputy sat pensively, each sharing their own table with two other companions. President Kenyatta shared his table with Chief Justice Martha Koome and Attorney-General Kihara Kariuki, while Deputy President Ruto shared his with National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi and his Senate counterpart Ken Lusaka - both Ruto allies in the Kenya Kwanza Alliance. The theme of this year's prayer breakfast is 'transition' which comes barely two months before the country heads for the general elections. President Kenyatta and his deputy have become foes - often engaging in bitter public exchanges as the succession race heats up. Kenyatta has said publicly that he "won't allow" Ruto to succeed him. President Kenyatta who is openly campaigning for opposition leader Raila Odinga, who was endorsed recently as the Azimio Coalition presidential candidate, stated that there can only be one winner in any election while urging political parties and individuals contesting for the presidency to concede defeat, to ensure peace in the country. Ruto also took the opportunity to apologise to his boss Kenyatta, for having not met his expectations during their 10 years in office.
