A school in Lagos, Nigeria, is accepting empty plastic bottles from parents in exchange for their children's school fees, thanks to a recycling project. Through the Recycle Pay Project Initiative, Grace and her sister and co-founder Rose Amuzie, are offering low-cost educational services to low-income families. The initiative which was introduced in 2019, was launched in partnership with the African Clean-up Initiative. Grace Amuzie recently won the first place at the Savvy Prize for Impact Driven Entrepreneurs.
