Zimbabwe and Kenya will not take part in the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, the Confederation of African Football has announced. Both nations are unable to contest next month's qualifiers because of their ongoing bans from international football, handed out by Fifa because of governmental interference in the running of the game.           The pair needed their bans lifted two weeks before their first Nations Cup qualifiers to be able to take part in the 2023 qualifying campaign. However, neither country has been able to gain readmission to the international fold.           The qualifiers will kick off on June 1 2022. Two of the three teams will now qualify for AFCON 2023.
