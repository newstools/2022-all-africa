Seven miners from Bucks Mine in Colleen Bawn are feared dead after hoisting ropes to a skip bringing them up the shaft from underground snapped, plunging them back on a free-fall of about 200 meters. Sources said the skip dragged the miners to the bottom of the shaft and first respondents to the scene saw splatters of blood on the walls of the shaft going down.           Although mining accidents are relatively common in decommissioned mines, particularly when the ground is loosened by rain, Zimbabwe's mining industry has come under scrutiny for human rights violations and environmental concerns. Mining is a major source of foreign currency for the southern African country, home to vast gold and mineral reserves, including diamonds and platinum.
