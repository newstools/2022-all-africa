Residents of Nelson Mandela Bay say the municipality continues to ignore their demand for help with the area's severe water crisis, Joseph Chirume of GroundUp reports. Residents and members of the Nelson Mandela Bay Water Crisis Committee blame the municipality for the metro's impending Day Zero. Day Zero refers to a period of severe water shortage in the Western Cape region, most notably affecting the City of Cape Town. While dam water levels had been declining since 2015, the Cape Town water crisis peaked during mid-2017 to mid-2018 when water levels hovered between 15 and 30 percent of total dam capacity. Residents say municipal officials failed to replace ageing water infrastructure and don't fix frequent leakages. The group also approached the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) to investigate allegations of corruption and mismanagement.
