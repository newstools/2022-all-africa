Swiss non-profit, NEAR, has announced a partnership with local blockchain community, Sankore to launch a regional hub in Kenya dedicated to blockchain innovation, education, and talent development in Africa, Capital FM reports. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain, according to Euromoney. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain. Comprised of events, an academy, an incubation program, and the Sankore Bounty ecosystem, the hub will be a promising intersection of Africa's most talented blockchain developers and international support for their innovations. The continent has been undergoing a rapid digital revolution over the past decade, and African countries have been adopting cryptocurrency quicker than their global counterparts. Cryptocurrency adoption in Africa increased 1,200% from July 2020 to June 2021, the fastest adoption rate in the world.
