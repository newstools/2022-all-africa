Senegal President Macky Sall's ruling coalition said on Monday August 1, 2022 it had won 30 of the country's 46 administrative departments, news agency Reuters reports from Dakar. That would give the coalition a slim majority parliament. Former prime minister Aminata Toure, who led the ruling coalition's list in the legislative election held on July 31, 2022, announced the partial results on national television from the party's headquarters.           Under Senegal's hybrid electoral system, 97 candidates who win a majority of votes in administrative departments are elected, while 53 from national lists are elected using proportional representation, and 15 are elected by Senegalese living outside the country.           Barthelemy Dias, mayor of the capital Dakar, and a leader in the main opposition coalition which has been energised by economic hardship and fears of Sall's third term ambition, immediately disputed the results announced by Toure, warning that it was not her place to announce results of the election.           Deutsche Welle reports that the opposition used the election to challenge Sall's majority, in the hopes of curbing a potential bid for a third term.           A total of eight coalitions contested the elections. They included Yewwi Askan Wi (which means "Liberate the People" in Wolof), Senegal's main opposition coalition. Yewwi Askan Wi's highest profile member is former presidential candidate Ousmane Sonko. Sonko came third in the 2019 presidential election which Sall won. Last year, his arrest on rape charges, which he denies, sparked deadly violence.
