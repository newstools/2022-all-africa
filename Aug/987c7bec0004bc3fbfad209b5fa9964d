Despite leaders saying that the people want them to stay longer than two terms, a survey done by Afrobarometer indicates that leaders who stay for more than two terms are not what the people want. This study done in 34 African countries found that an average of 76% favour limiting their presidents to two terms, including a majority of 54% who strongly support this rule.           "History has shown that democracy is essential for sustained peace, security and human development. Democracy must be protected, defended, cultivated through regular civic practice and education, never taken for granted and forever refreshed from generation to generation. Respect for constitutionalism promotes rule of law and political accountability. Term limits in particular, by facilitating regular transitions of power, help prevent sustained concentrations of political and economic authority that will gradually and inevitably undermine democracy," said National Democratic Institute President Derek Mitchell, during the second three-day Constitutional Term Limits Summit held in Botswana with the aim to strengthen good governance and democracy in Africa.
