The U.N. peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo has arrested U.N. peacekeeping troops suspected of having opened fire at a Ugandan border post, killing at least two people and injuring 15 others. It's the latest violent incident involving the U.N.'s mission which has been facing violent protests.           UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was "outraged, saddened and dismayed" by the deaths and demanded accountability.           Uganda meanwhile says it has deployed a team to monitor ongoing tensions in Kasindi in Beni territory, close to Uganda.
