The prolonged drought impacting the north, which has left more than 2.5 million people on the brink of starvation and poverty, is only the latest in an increasingly short cycle that is leaving pastoralists and farmers with less and less time to recover, writes Sara Mbago-Bhunu. This has prompted the Kenyan government to send emergency aid to 23 arid and semi-arid countries to assist some 2.3 million Kenyans. President Kenyatta has also said that there would be greater investment in community-based resilience and drought preparedness programmes, according to Capital FM.       However, promising innovations are helping farmers in different regions and facing different conditions to reduce their reliance on unpredictable rains and are slowly but surely helping them to become more productive and resilient - despite the rising challenges of climate change.
