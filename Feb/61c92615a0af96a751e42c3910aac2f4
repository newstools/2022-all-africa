South Africa is sending fresh troops and armored vehicles to Mozambique's northern Cabo Delgado province as part of efforts to fight insurgents. The deployment is part of the Southern African Development Community's (SADC) military intervention, which started in July 2021. More than 3,000 SADC and Rwandan troops have been sent to Mozambique to fight against insurgents. The conflict has claimed more than three thousand lives and displaced 800,000 people. Meanwhile, five years after violent extremists began attacking Cabo Delgado province, the country is developing its first counter-terrorism strategy. This Resilience and Development Strategy for the North is expected to be funded by donors to the tune of hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars.
