The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) has dismissed allegations that it has tempered with the voters' roll ahead of the March 26, 2022 by-elections. This comes after a social media activist group had claimed that the commission had moved 170,000 voters from their original constituencies and wards ahead of the by-elections. In a statement, ZEC said the allegations were meant to weaken public confidence and the country's electoral process, as well as tarnish the image of the Commission. Zimbabwe will hold by-elections to fill vacancies in local authorities and the National Assembly - most of which fell vacant because of internal opposition politics, although in some cases, the passing away of some candidates.
