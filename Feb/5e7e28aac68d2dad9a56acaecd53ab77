Displaced by months-long violence and persecution, hundreds of civilians from the Amhara community who lived in Wollega zone, western Oromia regional state, are seeking refuge in Addis Ababa. Hundreds more have been forced to relocate to the Arsi zone in the Oromia regional state, an investigation by Addis Standard reveals. The ongoing violence in East Wollega and Horogudru zones in western Oromia is driving thousands of people from their homes amid ongoing attacks by "armed groups" belonging to local Amhara militia. The fleeing residents complain that the local administration is forcing them to return to their villages, while the assailants are not stopped by authorities.
