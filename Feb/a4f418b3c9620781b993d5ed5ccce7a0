President Cyril Ramaphosa is leading a continental campaign to cancel Israel's status as an accredited observer at the African Union (AU), prompting the South African Jewish community to accuse his government of an "obsession" and "relentless hostility" to Israel, Peter Fabricius writes for Daily Maverick. Israel was accepted as an observer to the AU by the chairperson of the African Union Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat in August 2021, joining more than 90 other countries which enjoy that status. But South Africa in particular, leading the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and Algeria, leading some African members of the League of Arab States, objected to Faki's decision. International Relations and Cooperation Minister Naledi Pandor complained then that the AU Commission had taken this "unjust and unwarranted decision... unilaterally without consultation with its member states." The South Africa government's relationship with Israel has seen strain following differences with organisers of the Miss South Africa pageant, and calls by striking workers - protesting retrenchments and longer work hours - to nationalise Clover, a local dairy giant that recently merged with Milco, a subsidiary of the Israeli Central Bottling Company.
