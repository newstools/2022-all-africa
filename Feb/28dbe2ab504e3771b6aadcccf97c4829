In a statement that set social media on fire, President Emmerson Mnangagwa vowed not to relinquish power under any circumstances, claiming there was no way in which an opposition leader can rule Zimbabwe. The president dismissed Coalition for Citizens' Change (CCC) led by Nelson Chamisa, his fiercest nemesis, saying the newly founded party has no chance. Addressing party supporters in Epworth during the launch of Zanu-PF's campaign ahead of the March 26, 2022  by-elections, Mnangagwa said only his party can rule Zimbabwe. In the meantime, while campaigning in Harare East, the CCC Deputy President Tendai Biti said education would be free from pre-school to postgraduate studies under a Nelson Chamisa-led government. By-elections are being held in 28 parliamentary seats and 105 vacancies are to be filled by local authorities.
