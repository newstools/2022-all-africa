Crypto exchange Binance has restricted the personal accounts of some Nigerian users to comply with antimoney laundering regulations and ensure the security of the platform for traders. Many Nigerians trading on the Binance platform complained recently of inability to initiate or complete transactions. Users have faced challenges trading crypto since the Central Bank of Nigeria in 2021 asked lenders not to transact with cryptocurrency exchanges and ordered digital currency traders to shut down accounts.  The announcement came months after it banned financial institutions from cryptocurrency-related transactions in the country, claiming the digital currency is used for money laundering and terrorism.
