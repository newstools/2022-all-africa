In 2018 a peace agreement under the leadership of President Salva Kiir was signed - it should have ended conflict in the country. But a national unified army remains to be formed, and the legislative and constitutional work that would be needed before prospective elections in 2023 has barely begun. Violence is reported to have increased since the signing of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan(R-ARCSS). Tensions are predicted to likely increase as the country progresses towards elections, tentatively forecast for 2023: Candidate selection will be an occasion for jockeying for position, and the use of violence in political negotiations is expected to intensify.           The power-sharing arrangement contained in the peace agreement means that all positions are given out on the basis of party affiliation. The peace agreement is not a roadmap to a flourishing South Sudan, its partial implementation has largely destroyed whatever popular legitimacy the South Sudanese political system once had, undermined grassroots institutions, and intensified a process that began in 2005: the creation of a wealthy class of military and political leaders in Juba, atop a rentier economy, dependent on shrinking oil reserves and humanitarian resources, which uses violence as a tool of population management in the rest of the country, writes Joshua Craze and Ferenc David Marko for African Arguments.
