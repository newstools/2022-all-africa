The media fraternity has welcomed the government's decision to lift a ban on four newspapers that was imposed by the late president John Magufuli. President Samia Suluhu Hassan's government issued new publishing licences to newspapers Mwanahalisi, Mawio, Mseto, and Tanzania Daima. The latter is owned by opposition leader Freeman Mbowe, who is behind bars, facing economic charges. The newspapers were banned in 2017 for breaching media laws and professional ethics. Speaking during a meeting with editors, the Minister of Information Nape Nnauye said the papers' licences were restored on the orders of the president, as part of her promise to uphold press freedom. However, the government has suspended other papers deemed to have run foul of Tanzania's media law. In 2021, the weekly paper Raia Mwema was suspended for 30 days for linking a gunman who killed four people to the ruling party, reports Charles Kombe for Voice of America.
