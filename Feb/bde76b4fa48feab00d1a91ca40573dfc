The energy ministry wants a total ban on scrap metal businesses  across the country following the rampant vandalism of electricity infrastructure. Over the past five years, more than 200 pylons, as well as other valuable electricity infrastructure worth billions of Shillings, has been vandalized across the country, something affecting the Electricity Connection Policy and the National Development Plan III's target of increasing electricity coverage to 60% of the population by 2027. Sidronius Okasai Opolot, the minister for state energy has said the ministry is currently in talks with the trade ministry, to initiate a total ban on the buying and selling of scrap metal, as of the ways of ending the rampant vandalism of electricity infrastructure. In January 2022, neighbouring Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta banned any exports or dealings in scrap metal until proper guidelines are put in place to regulate the sector. Kenyatta stated that tough action will be taken against anyone found culpable of vandalism.
