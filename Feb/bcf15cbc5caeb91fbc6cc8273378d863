Tanzanian president Samia Suluhu Hassan has said all underperforming District Executive Directors (DEDs) will face the chop by 18 February. The president's warning comes hardly two days after she revoked the appointment of four district executive directors due to misappropriation of the fund released by the International Monetary Fund to counter the effects of Covid- 19 pandemic. Suluhu Hassan reminded DEDs that they are still in their six months' probation since their appointment in August last year, which will expire on February 18th. She also directed the Minister of State in the President's Office Innocent Bashungwa to submit a six-month performance report of the DEDs to determine whether they are fit for the roles, maintaining that the orders also apply for the four DEDs who have been dismissed.
