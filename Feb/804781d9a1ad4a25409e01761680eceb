Over the past few decades research has demonstrated the huge potential of microalgae, especially in the production of biofuel - fuel that is created from plant material or animal waste. The Conversation's Callum Russell sought to review this research to provide a framework to establish the most suitable microalgae species for large-scale biofuel production that can ultimately rival oil and gas giants and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Biofuel made from microalgae is currently one of the most promising fossil fuel alternatives to sustain the world's energy demand. This is no easy task, especially having to compete with a highly profitable industry that has been established for more than a century. But unlike oil, which is non-renewable, biofuel is a renewable and sustainable source of fuel.
