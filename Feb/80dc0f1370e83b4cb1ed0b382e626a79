The Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) has warned that the upcoming election period could pose danger to journalists in the region. In a statement, Misa also expressed concern over  undemocratic laws that are being crafted in some countries that have threatened media freedoms during the Covid-19 pandemic. MISA regional director Tabani Moyo has bemoaned the worsening media freedom violations in Southern Africa saying Zimbabwe was the leading offender. Moyo said media violations are expected to escalate as the southern African country prepares for elections, starting with the March 26 by-elections, seen as a dress rehearsal for the 2023 general elections.
