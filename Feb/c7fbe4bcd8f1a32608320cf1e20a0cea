A new online course by the World Health Organisation (WHO) called Infodemic Management 101 is now available on the OpenWHO.org platform. A press release from the global health body read: Thanks to this online training, anyone can learn the basics of Infodemic management, anytime, from anywhere. A dozen of global experts explore the growing field of infodemic management activities and explain how to fight misinformation spread and to design human-centered interventions to empower individuals and communities. An infodemic is an overabundance of information, both online and offline. It includes deliberate attempts to disseminate wrong information to undermine the public health response and advance alternative agendas of groups or individuals.
