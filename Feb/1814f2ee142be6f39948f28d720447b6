The police have arrested suspended deputy commissioner of police, Abba Kyari, over his alleged involvement in drug trafficking. Kyari and four other police officers are facing charges that include criminal conspiracy, discreditable, unethical, and unprofessional conduct, official corruption and tampering with exhibits in a case of illicit drug trafficking involving a perpetual transnational drug cartel," a police statement said. The police added that Kyari's involvement in the drug deal occurred while on suspension. Kyari was suspended in August 2021, following an FBI indictment linking him to money launderer Ramon Abbas, also known as Hushpuppi, who is awaiting sentencing by a U.S. court for his role in cybercrimes. Kyari is accused of agreeing to detain one of Hushpuppi's co-conspirators after they had fallen out.   Kyari was lauded as Nigeria's most decorated cop and was deputy commissioner in charge of the police's Intelligence Response Team (IRT) until his suspension. He was conferred with a presidential medal for courage by Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari in 2016.
