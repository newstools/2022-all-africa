The European Union (EU) has renewed sanctions on members of the ruling Zanu-PF party and added government's arms manufacturing company, the Zimbabwe Defence Industries, barely two days after President Emmerson Mnangagwa returned from a high profile summit at the multilateral organisation's headquarters in Brussels. Mnangagwa was in Belgium attending a corporative summit between the EU and the African Union. The EU decried the failure by the Zimbabwean government to improve its human rights record, but lifted sanctions on Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, Zimbabwe Defence Forces Commander, General Valerio Sibanda and former First Lady Grace Mugabe. EU sanctions on Zimbabwe were first imposed in 2002 in response to a council assessment that then president Robert Mugabe's government was engaged in serious violations of human rights, as well as violations of the freedom of opinion, freedom of association and freedom of peaceful assembly.
