A frantic rescue operation is underway in northern Morocco to save a 5-year-old boy who has been trapped in a deep well for nearly three days, Deutsche Welle reports. The boy, named Rayan, fell down a narrow 32-meter (100-foot) deep well in the village of Ighran in the country's Chefchaouen province. "The child's rescue is approaching," government spokesperson Mustapha Baitas told the media. "Our hearts are with the family, and we are praying that he will back with them as soon as possible." Relief workers managed to provide an oxygen tube and water to the child using pipes, Morocco's official MAP news agency reported.
