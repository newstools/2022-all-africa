Unions have called for a boycott of Clover products to protest against restructuring and job losses, Masego Mafata of GroundUp reports. Clover management said the decision to restructure was taken in the light of difficult trading conditions. Unions supporting striking workers of the dairy producer said the strike will continue. The unions and Clover management failed to reach an agreement during recent negotiations. Workers are demanding that Clover stop plans for further retrenchments, factory closures and salary cuts. They also demand that the company reinstate all dismissed workers. This comes after the dairy company approached the labour court for an interdict against both the worker strike and the consumer boycott campaign. Workers' frustrations can be traced back to November 2021 following the purchase of 60% of Clover by Milco, a subsidiary of the Israeli Central Bottling Company However, the firm moved to retrench workers, implement a 12-hour work day six days a week and a new disregard for public holidays.
