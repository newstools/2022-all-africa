All ports of entry have been reopened by Zimbabwe for fully vaccinated travellers with valid Covid-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test certificates, following convincing progress in the containment of the novel coronavirus. The re-opening of borders has been greeted with excitement by the tourism sector which say that the move will boost their operations. The tourism sector has been the hardest-hit industry worldwide, following imposition of travel restrictions as countries responded to the global Covid-19 pandemic. Like many parts of the world Zimbabwe's border entry points remained closed, while prohibitive PCR test requirements and quarantine terms restricted tourists from travelling. Zimbabwe shares four land borders with Botswana at Plumtree, Mlambapele, Mpoengs and Maitengwe, and Beitbridge with South Africa. Prior to the latest Cabinet decision, only commercial cargo and Zimbabweans with permits to live or work in other countries were allowed to depart via land borders.
