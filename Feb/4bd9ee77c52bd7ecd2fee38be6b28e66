A few years ago, traditional vegetables and local foods in Kenya were largely perceived as foods of the poor and of the past. Local markets were dominated by three exotic vegetables: cabbage, kale (locally known as sukuma wiki) and Swiss chard (spinach).           Unhealthy 'junk' food was gaining popularity, especially among young people. This trend is worrying, as Kenyan communities risk losing their healthy traditional foods and the cultural heritage associated with them, including language, knowledge, skills and practices. To address the growing bias against traditional Kenyan foods, local and international institutions, including research organisations, government ministries, non-governmental and community based organisations, and universities rolled out nutrition research on the value in local foods,writes Patrick Maundu for The Conversation. .
