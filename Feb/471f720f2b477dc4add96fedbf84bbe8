The government of Botswana has amended a proposed surveillance law which triggered widespread protests from domestic and regional media organisations. The amendments reinstate judicial oversight over surveillance, interceptions and seizures and criminalise abuse of the government's surveillance powers. News of the amendments came after a coalition of organisations representing journalists across Southern Africa met in the capital, Gaborone, at the invitation of the Botswana Editors' Forum. The journalists said the law would have threatened the work of journalists and freedom of expression.
