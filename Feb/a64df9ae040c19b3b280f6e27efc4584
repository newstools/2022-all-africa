Barely a week after Tropical Storm Ana brought winds, heavy rains, damage and destruction to parts of Madagascar, Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, Tropical Cyclone Batsirai continues to strengthen as it approaches a Madagascar landfall. The cyclone, which has formed in the Indian Ocean in recent days, is expected to make landfall on the east coast of Madagascar around February 5, after passing by Mauritius. The cyclone season in the south-west Indian Ocean intensified in January 2022, with Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe all facing damage and destruction from heavy rainfall and flooding.
