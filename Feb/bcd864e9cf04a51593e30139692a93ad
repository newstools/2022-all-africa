The primary and secondary teachers strike in South Kordofan has entered its sixth day of protest.  Teachers across South Kordofan are owed back-payments that extend to 2020. A salary top-up which was meant to come into effect had also not been received, leaving the teachers in a state of complete financial insecurity, the head of a teacher's union in South Kordofan, has told Radio Dabanga. The strike scheduled for March 3, 2022 will turn into an open strike if teachers do not receive their full financial dues and all the governors in South Kordofan will be punished for not acknowledging their financial grievances, the union head said. New protests and strikes are currently happening trhoughout Sudan. On February 23, 2022 people with special needs protested, after their schools never reopened at the same time as public schools two months ago. On February 21, 2022 dozens of university lecturers organised a protest in front of the Council of Ministers in Khartoum to denounce the failure to pay their salaries for January 2022. They announced a comprehensive strike until salaries are paid, reports Radio Dabanga.
