Inaction and in speech, the ruler of eSwatini and his government refuse to listen to the mass democratic movement's demands for a genuine dialogue. The emotional and physical scarring of the torture and intimidation that students endured at the hands of security forces in eSwatini hadn't healed when King Mswati III preached about peace and the need for dialogue. Mswati, in the official opening of the fourth session of the country's 11th Parliament, claimed to "discourage the use of force and violence to influence change as we all deserve to live in peace". It's against this background that Mswati's call for peace is viewed as nothing more than grandstanding with no intention to honour his words. He followed his call for peace by claiming that "it is not a crime to have diverging views, but engaging in dialogue creates a better outcome for all, as every person needs advice from time to time". But the dialogue he wants to happen, prompted by the 2021 intervention of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) following months of pro-democracy protests in which the country's security forces killed dozens and injured scores, will occur under his own terms if it is to go ahead, writes Cebelihle Mbuyisa for New Frame.
