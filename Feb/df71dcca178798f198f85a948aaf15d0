More than 15,000 children, aged between 7 and 14 years live in Kampala's streets. According to city authorities, at least 100 children are taken off the roads every month. The government plans to rehabilitate the street children and reintegrate them back into their family homes. In 2019, Kampala passed a law banning giving money or food to street children. City authorities said the law was aimed at curbing children's commercial and sexual exploitation. Offenders could face up to six months imprisonment, or a fine of U.S.$11. The high number of children leaving their homes for the streets has forced child support organisations to think of new strategies for interventions. Mondo Kyateka, Uganda's Commissioner for Youth and Children, said parents and guardians who have failed to fulfil their responsibilities were responsible for the current crisis. She warned that they would be punished for neglect when identified. But not everyone blames poor parenting alone for the crisis. Child care organisations in Uganda have said the return of children to Kampala's busy streets is also because law enforcement officals often delay routine operations to round them up.
