Rights groups are criticising the proposed amendment to the Public Health Act announced by government, that will impose fines and jail sentences on those who evade measures meant to curb the spread of infectious disease. The bill does not specifically mention Covid-19. The bill states that whoever conceals an infectious disease could face fines of U.S.$850 or up to one year in jail. School administrators who admit students without evidence of vaccination, or a parent who fails to present their child for vaccination, could face up to six months in jail, a fine of about U.S.$1,100 or both. The bill is before the health committee in parliament, which will carry out public consultations on whether the new amendments are necessary.
