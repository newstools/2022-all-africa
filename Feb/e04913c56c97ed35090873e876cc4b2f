Robert Kyagulanyi Sentamu, also known as singer Bobi Wine - leader of the National Unity Platform and political rival of President Yoweri Museveni - has asked the European Union (EU) to re-evaluate its partnership with Uganda. Speaking at the fifth Annual Africa Week Conference in Brussels, he asked that the EU places its focus on the Ugandan people and not the government. Kyagulanyi said that by funding government, the EU is indirectly sponsoring torture in the country because government uses the donations and funds they receive to mistreat ordinary people. "We call upon the EU to set real democracy and observance of the rule of law as a precondition for giving support to Uganda," Kyagulanyi stressed. His invitation as a keynote speaker at this year's edition of the conference comes at a time when one of his party coordinators became the latest victim of alleged government brutality, with visible wounds from torture while in detention. Critical novelist Kakwenza Rukirabashaija is also another victim, whose wounds and torture marks sparked debate in the media as well as in the Ugandan parliament.
