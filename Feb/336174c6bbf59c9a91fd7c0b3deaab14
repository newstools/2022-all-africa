Five members of interim President Assimi Goita's inner circle, including Prime Minister Choguel Kokalla Maiga, will not be able to pass through European Union (EU) countries. They have also been subjected to "an asset freeze", Deutsche Welle reports. The EU blacklisted five members of transitional interim Mali President Assimi Goita's inner circle, including his prime minister, after the military scrapped plans to hold elections in February 2022, according to a statement. The travel bans and asset freezes affect Prime Minister Choguel Kokalla Maiga and top military commanders who ousted former Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita from power in August 2020. Keita died last month at the age of 76.
