Seven children have been killed in Niger in an air strike by the Nigerian army targeting "bandits", said Chaibou Aboubacar, the governor of Maradi region.  Aboubacar said the strike occurred on February 18, 2022 in the village of Nachade and that four of the children died instantly while three others died on their way to  hospital. Niger and Nigeria have been conducting joint military operations against armed gangs responsible for a wave of kidnappings and killings in the region. The Maradi region in Niger is one of the most affected by the violence created by bandits in neighbouring Nigerian states, Katsina, Sokoto, and Zamfara. In 2017, a Nigerian air force fighter jet mistakenly bombed a town crowded with people who had fled Islamist militants, killing more than 50 people. Nigerian officials said an investigation is underway.
