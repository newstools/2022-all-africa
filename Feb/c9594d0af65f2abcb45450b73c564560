Tropical Cyclone Batsirai has moved further southward away from Zimbabwe, the country's meteorological department has said. According to the government, six more tropical cyclones are expected to hit Zimbabwe before the end of the rainy season in April. In Madagascar, the death toll from Cyclone Batsirai rose to 92, the state disaster relief agency has said, as information continued to filter in from areas of the country that were badly affected. Batsirai, southern Africa's second biggest cyclone this year, was forecast to dissipate further as it exits Madagascar and should not pose a serious risk to Mozambique, said the weather department. South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa told a summit of African leaders on February 6, 2022 that the continent was "experiencing the worst impacts of phenomena associated with global warming such as droughts, floods and cyclones".
