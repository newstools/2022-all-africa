The United Nations' Secretary-General has made the "strongest possible appeal" for all parties in Ethiopia to immediately end the fighting in Tigray and other areas, in the spirit of the General Assembly's Olympic Truce which began just a few days ago. Speaking to journalists in New York, António Guterres said that it would allow for effective humanitarian access and relief to all affected populations throughout Ethiopia. As the UN chief prepares to leave for the Winter Olympics, he reiterated his appeal to all parties to follow the finest tradition of the Olympic spirit to save lives, overcome differences and find the path to real peace. At the same time, a relentless drought in Ethiopia will leave more than 6.8 million people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance by mid-March, says UNICEF. In the most severely impacted regions away from the fighting in the north, there is a significant lack of clean water and food security is deteriorating rapidly, reports UN News Service.
