As Liberia celebrates 200 years of existence as a nation-state after it was established freed slaves from the United States of America, U.S. Head of Delegation to Liberia's Bicentennial Celebration Dana Banks has said it's time for Liberians to stop depending on the U.S. and the rest of the international community to solve its problems. The delegation signed a U.S.$55 million Health Partnership with the government of Liberia. The launch of the bilateral agreement is intended to improve the health of Liberians for the next five years. According to the U.S. Embassy in Monrovia, the Health Partnership demonstrates the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to strengthening health systems; combatting malaria; advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights; maternal, neonatal, and child health; and accelerating efforts towards universal health coverage. President George M. Weah has called on citizens home and abroad to rally and unite to a new world of globalisation, not permitting politics to divide their country. He urged Liberians to glance beyond the bicentennial, into a new world of science and technology, as well as a new world of globalisation and a new world where liberty, equality, stability, justice, peace and prosperity under the rule of law are guaranteed for citizens. The president, in a speech commemorating the country's 200th founding, noted that the issue of unity and reconciliation must become the imperative agenda of all current and future national development policies and that projects and programs emanating from these "policies should focus on eliminating all forms of discrimination and exclusion in Liberia".
