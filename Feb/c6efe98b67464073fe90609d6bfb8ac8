In 2005, the International Court of Justice ordered Uganda to pay reparations to DR Congo for the effects of a brutal 1998-2003 war - an invastion that left hundreds of thousands of people dead and saw the displacement of mllions. The DR Congo first brought the case to the court in 1999.  The Hague-based court ordered the African neighbours to negotiate reparations, but they could not reach an agreement. In 2015 the DR Congo took the case back to the court for a final decision on the amount to be paid. The court has now determined that the amount of U.S.$325,000,000 will be paid in compensation to the DR Congo. This amount includes U.S.$225,000,000 for damages to persons, U.S.$40,000,000 for damage to property, and U.S.$60,000,000 for damage related to natural resources. The total sum is to be paid in annual instalments of U.S$65,000,000, due on September 1 of each year, from 2022 to 2026. The court further stated that should payment be delayed, post-judgment interest at an annual rate of 6% on each instalment will accrue on any overdue amount from the day which follows the day on which the instalment was due. The court noted that the reparation awarded to the DR Congo for damage to persons and to property reflects the harm suffered by individuals and communities as a result of Uganda's breach of its international obligations. The DR Congo initially demanded U.S.$11 billion in reparation but Uganda said that the amount could ruin its economy.
