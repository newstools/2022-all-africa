A report by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) says climate change will fuel an increase in wildfires in coming decades. The report warns that if preventive measures are not taken, the fires will damage environments, human health, and economies. The report, released on February 23, 2022 ahead of the 5th session of the United Nations Environment Assembly to be held in Nairobi next week, describes how climate change and how people's use of land are expected to increase wildfires globally by 50% by 2100. Environmental experts are calling for the use of data and science-based monitoring systems with indigenous knowledge, to achieve robust regional and international cooperation. The report also calls for international safety standards and asks countries to work on policies and laws that encourage good land and fire use.
