Public universities in Ghana are on the verge of a shutdown unless lecturers currently on strike for over four weeks return to work. The lecturers, who are part of the national umbrella body called the University Teachers Association of Ghana (UTAG), downed tools on January 10, 2022, over poor working conditions. The lecturers' union said the government had refused to implement a pay policy that pegs their basic salary and market premium at U.S.$2,084. This payment aims to prevent workers like university lecturers from abandoning their jobs for other sectors or even traveling abroad to teach elsewhere. Besides an increase in their salaries, the lecturers are also demanding a raise in book and research allowances, reports Isaac Kaledzi for Deutsche Welle. While the government hopes the lecturers will call off their strike sooner than later, the impact on students is becoming severe. Thousands of local and international students have been stranded for weeks. Meanwhile in Nigeria, the Academic Staff Union of Universities has also raised issues over poor working conditions. The university lecturers have threatened to embark on a nationwide strike to fight for their demands. Should this threat be carried out, it would be the second major strike in two years. The previous strike lasted nine months, leading to the loss of almost a full academic year in Nigeria.
