The African Union heads of states and government have approved Kiswahili as one of the bloc's official working languages following a request from Tanzania's Vice President Phillip Mpango. Kiswahili is one of the most widely spoken languages in Africa spoken by over 100 million people within and outside the continent as well as a teaching language in many African countries. Mpango said it is already in use in various communities including the East African Community (EAC), the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) declared July 7 as the World Kiswahili Language Day.
