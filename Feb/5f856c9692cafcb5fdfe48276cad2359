South Africa is scrambling to repair relations with the Kremlin after International Relations and Cooperation Minister Naledi Pandor issued an unusually strong statement calling on Russia to withdraw from Ukraine, Peter Fabricius of Daily Maverick reports. A day after the statement from the Department of International Relations and Cooperation which called for Russia to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, President Cyril Ramaphosa seemed instead to blame U.S. President Joe Biden for the invasion. He suggested that if Biden had agreed to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin unconditionally days before Moscow's attack on Ukraine, it would have been averted. The diplomatic efforts come after Russians, Ukrainians and other Europeans protested in Johannesburg against Russia's invasion of Ukraine. African leaders have reacted with concern to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with the South African government calling for the withdrawal of troops. As African students who are studying in the Ukraine call for help, world markets recoil and global trade is threatened, the continent watches to see what the fallout will be.
