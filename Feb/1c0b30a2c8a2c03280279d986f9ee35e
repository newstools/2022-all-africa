Burkina Faso boss Kamou Malo vowed on Tuesday February 1, 2022 that his team would stick to their playing style despite facing Senegal - Africa's strongest team - in a semi-final of the Africa Cup of Nations, writes Paul Myers for Radio France Internationale. Senegal, under Aliou Cissé, go into the tie as favourites. The sides clash on Wednesday February 2, 2022 at the Stade Ahmadou Ahidjo in Yaoundé. Hosts Cameroon take on Egypt in the other semi-final at the Olembé Stadium on Thursday February 3, 2022. The arena was cleared for the match after local fixers and the Cameroon government assured CAF - the overall organisers - that safety measures would be tightened up to prevent the string of events that led to the fan stampede which left eight people dead and 38 injured just before Cameroon's last-16 tie against Comoros on 24 January, 2022.
