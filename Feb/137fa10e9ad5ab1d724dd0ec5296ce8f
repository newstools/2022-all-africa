France's decision to withdraw its troops from Mali came after relations between the two countries soured, when Mali did not act on an agreement to organise presidential elections for February 2022. Mali also reportedly accepted the help of private Russian military contractors.  French President Emmanuel Macron said: "France's military withdrawal from Mali does not mean the mission was a failure. The anti-insurgency operation will continue, but based in other countries". Senegal is among African countries that warn they cannot fight insurgency from militant group Al Qaeda on their own. The UN has said the withdrawal is bound to have an effect on its peacekeeping mission in Mali.
