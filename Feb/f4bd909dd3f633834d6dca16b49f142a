The Minister of Minerals and Mining Gwede Mantashe and oil giant Shell has had no joy from the Makhanda High Court which ruled that the interim interdict that was issued in December, 2021, be upheld. This decision was in relation to Shell's application to explore for oil and gas along the Eastern Cape's Wild Coast region - a move that has been met with environmentalist and Eastern Cape citizens' protests over the environmental impact of the surveys on the region. Local fishers have also been protesting at the impact such surveys would have on their livelihoods.
