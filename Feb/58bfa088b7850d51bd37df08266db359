Five years after violent extremists began attacking Mozambique's northern Cabo Delgado province, the country is developing its first counter-terrorism strategy. This Resilience and Development Strategy for the North is expected to be funded by donors to the tune of hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars.  Written by the government with input from donors, the strategy is scheduled to be approved by the cabinet in the first half of 2022. It is the first official document to recognise the role of internal factors in creating the conflict. It cites socio-economic inequalities, frustration related to the exploitation of natural resources, especially among the youth in the north, political and economic exclusion, and perceived marginalisation by the local population, Borges Nhamirre writes for the Institute for Security Studies.
