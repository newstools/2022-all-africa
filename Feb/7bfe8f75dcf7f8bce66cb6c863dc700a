Three times as many sites of sacred value, scientific wonder and natural splendour across Africa could face risks from human-caused climate change by the middle of the century, a study concludes. An international team of climate risk and heritage experts, including Nicholas Simpson of the African Climate and Development Initiative at the University of Cape Town, has, for the first time, provided a comprehensive assessment of exposure of African cultural and natural heritage sites to extreme sea levels and erosion associated with accelerating sea level rise. The research finds that 56 natural and cultural heritage sites across Africa already face threats from coastal flooding and erosion exacerbated by rising sea levels. By 2050, this figure is projected to increase to 191 under a "medium" emissions scenario and 198 under a "high" emissions scenario, if no further coastal defences are built.   Sea levels have been rising at a faster rate over the past three decades compared to the 20th century, the research says, and climate change hazards such as floods, heatwaves, and wildfires are becoming more common. The research finds that several African countries will see all of their cultural and natural heritage sites put at risk by 2100 in either scenario. These countries include Cameroon, the Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Western Sahara, Libya, Mozambique, Mauritania, and Namibia. Across the globe, sea-level rise is being driven by the melting of land ice and the expansion of water as it heats up. Sea levels around Africa rose at a faster rate than the global average over the past three decades, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
