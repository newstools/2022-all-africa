President Patrice Talon of Benin Republic, opened an exhibition of historic artworks returned by France in 2021, nearly 130 years after being stolen from the Dahomey kingdom.  The 26 pieces, some considered sacred in Benin, will be displayed at the presidential palace in Cotonou  The return of artifacts by France comes as calls grow in Africa for western countries to hand back colonial spoils from their museums and private collections. Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany have all received requests from African countries to return lost treasures.  While Nigerians hailed the return of the two bronze artworks to Benin City, a museum will be built to house the looted artefacts.
