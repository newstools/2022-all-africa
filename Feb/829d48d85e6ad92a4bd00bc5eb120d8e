Deputy President William Ruto is the most preferred presidential candidate ahead of Orange Democratic Movement leader Rala Odinga, according to the latest research by Trends and Insights Africa (TIFA). According to the study, 38% of citizens polled would vote for Ruto while 27% would choose Odinga. The exercise further revealed that the popularity ratings of Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka was at 2% while that of Mudavadi was at 1%. Deputy President William Ruto has blasted Murang'a representative Sabina Chege for claiming that the Jubilee administration rigged the 2017 General Election and that there is a likelihood of a repeat in the August polls. He stressed that neither he or President Uhuru Kenyatta rigged the votes, adding that the victory against Odinga was clean and genuine. According to Michelle Gavin for Council on Foreign Relations, Odinga is a known quantity engaged in his fifth campaign for the presidency. In the past five years he has gone from the incumbent Kenyatta's bitter rival to Kenyatta's preferred successor. Meanwhile, Ruto, who is technically Kenyatta's deputy and was once the incumbent's close political ally, is now at odds with the president. He is running as an agent of change, an outsider in solidarity with Kenya's working class despite his current role in government, his decades as a parliamentarian and Cabinet minister, and his substantial fortune.
