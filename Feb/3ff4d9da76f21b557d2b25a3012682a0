Thousands of demonstrators have been defying a ban on protests and have marched in Khartoum calling for a fully civilian government to lead the country. Since the 25 October 2021 coup, at least 79 people have been killed and the internet has been blocked for long periods. The protests have remained peaceful, and people have not stopped coming, despite the military's use of excessive force. The main protest organisers are the neighbourhood or resistance committees and the Sudanese Professionals Association. Initially established in 2012, the neighbourhood committees were run by young volunteers to ensure essentials such as bread, sugar and cooking gas - were distributed. They developed into underground resistance committees and, together with the Sudan Professional Association (an association of health workers, doctors and lawyers), organised people into marches throughout Khartoum and in other towns. They say they will not back down until the fall of the coup regime, and until the military leaders are held to account for the atrocities they have committed. We believe that the reasons for continued protests are a combination of; historical proof that demonstrations can bring change, previous experience in organising protests and because they're driven by young people who have the tools and energy to keep pushing and who have little faith in others to make the change happen, writes Lovise Aalen and Mai Azzam for the Conversation.
