A coalition of Nigerian activists have protested in capital city Abuja, demanding that President Mohammadu Buhari sign a bill that aims to improve transparency, inclusion, and planning for national elections. The activists are demanding President Mohammadu Buhari sign into law a bill that would promote the early release of funds for elections, the inclusion of marginalised groups in voting, and the authorisaton for the electronic transmission of election results. Among the organisations that protested were Partners for Electoral Reform, Nigeria Civil Society Room, Yiaga Africa, Centre for Journalism Innovation and Development, International Press Institute, Cleen Foundation, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, Enough is Enough and the Electoral Hub. Presidential spokesperson Femi Adesina, said the president had only received the bill from the Senate on January 31, 2022 and had until March 1, 2022 to sign it. Activists say the president already has declined to sign the bill five times. In December 2021, the president rejected the bill that was sent to him on November 19, 2021 citing his disagreement with the provision of only direct mode of primaries in the bill.
