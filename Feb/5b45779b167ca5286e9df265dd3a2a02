Zambia has made significant strides in the past two decades to improve maternal and newborn health outcomes. The maternal mortality rate dropped nearly 300% in 16 years - from 729 deaths for every 100,000 live births in 2002, to 278 deaths per 100,000 in 2018.  What has been critical in this achievement is greater availability of skilled midwifery personnel. The number of births assisted by a skilled attendant more than doubled over the same period, from 42% in 2002 to 80% in 2018. Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa have also seen a reduction in maternal mortality by as much as half since 2000. Still, there's a great variation in maternal deaths between low- and high-income countries. Low - and middle-income countries still account for a high proportion of the world's maternal deaths.
