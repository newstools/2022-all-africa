President Kais Saied has dissolved the Supreme Judicial Council. He said the body that deals with judicial independence "has become a thing of the past," Deutsche Welle reports. The announcement caps months of his sharp criticism of the judges, saying the judiciary is just "a function of the state." In July 2021, Saied plunged Tunisia into a constitutional crisis when he suspended the country's parliament, dismissed the sitting prime minister and granted himself executive powers. In January 2022 the Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties, also referred to as Ettakatol, warned against the "autocratic drift" of Saied, denouncing a concentration of powers in his hands under the guise of a "people's revolution."
