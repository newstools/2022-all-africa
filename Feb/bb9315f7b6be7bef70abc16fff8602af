President Uhuru Kenyatta has unveiled the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) national scale-up - calling on Kenyans to register for the National Health Insurance Fund. Kenyatta said the programme was started in 2013, with the highly acclaimed free maternity programme dubbed "Linda Mama", which currently benefits over one million mothers annually. The president affirmed the government's commitment to spreading the benefits of UHC across the country. Universal health coverage is one of the key pillars of the president's Big Four agenda, whose objectives are to ensure food security, quality and affordable healthcare, provide affordable and decent housing to an increasing population and create millions of jobs through manufacturing.
