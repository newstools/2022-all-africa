The Nigerian government says it has found an unsafe quantity of methanol in petrol imported into the country and has cited that as a reason for the latest round of fuel shortage that has led to long queues in Abuja and other major cities. Some Nigerians have taken to social media to complain about damage to their cars after buying what they describe as "dirty" petrol at filling stations. Nigerians especially in Abuja and Lagos have endured an erratic supply of fuel for nearly a year now, with filling stations operating at reduced capacity despite the government's repeated claims it has enough stocks. The crisis started in 2021 after the government announced its plan to remove fuel subsidy. Marketers, who the regulators accuse of hoarding the product, have refused to resume normal operations even after the suspension of the subsidy removal plan. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company has assured Nigerians that it has intensified efforts at increasing the supply of petrol into the market.
