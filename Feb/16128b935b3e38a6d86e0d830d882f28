Zimbabwe has been banned by FIFA, who are demanding that the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) board suspended by the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) be reinstated. The ZIFA board led by Felton Kamambo was suspended by SRC in 2021 over a litany of charges that include corruption and sexual abuse of female referees. No Zimbabwean football activity will be recognised by the governing body until the Kamambo-led administration has been reinstated. Earlier, the suspended ZIFA board formally applied to FIFA for sanctions on local football, following what they call a continued interference of the SRC in the running of the game in the country. FIFA had given the SRC, a government organisation, until January 3, 2022 to lift the suspension against the executives but has failed to heed the instruction.
