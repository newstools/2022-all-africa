Despite the intervention of SADC and Rwandan troops to support the Mozambican military, violence has continued to flare in Cabo Delgado districts and, recently, in neighbouring Niassa province. The conflict has triggered an acute humanitarian crisis and many of its underlying drivers such as extreme income inequality, endemic corruption and widespread organized crime remain unchanged. Mozambique's insurgents have been carrying out brutal attacks in the nation's north most province since 2017. The militants have now taken control of entire areas of Cabo Delgado and have expanded their operations inside and outside of Mozambique, according to a new joint study by the Geneva-based Global Initiative Against Transnational Crime and the Hanns Seidel Foundation in Germany.
