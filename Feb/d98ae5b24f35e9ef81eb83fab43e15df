Aid groups have condemned a militia group for killing at least 60 people at a camp for internally displaced people in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Reports say the Cooperative for Development of the Congo (CODECO) militia was responsible for the killings, which took place at the Savo camp in Ituri province. UNICEF has condemned the attack in which 15 children are initially reported to have been killed and more than 30 injured. CODECO is one of an array of militias operating in eastern Congo as a result of longstanding tensions over land and resources. Their militants have killed hundreds of civilians in Ituri in recent years and forced thousands to flee their homes, according to the United Nations.
