The Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, has blamed the Nigerian judiciary for the problem of delay in the determination of high-profile corruption cases in court. "As far as the present administration is concerned, delay of cases does not arise. If you are looking at it from the perspective of the legislative framework, we are enforcing provisions of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, as in day-in-day-out prosecution of cases," the attorney general said in an interview on Channels Television's primetime programme, 'Politics Today'.  Despite efforts to accelerate the conclusion of corruption cases in Nigeria, many high-profile litigations still linger in courts for many years, over what lawyers blame on the "shenanigans" of parties, reports the Daily Trust. Some major cases still dragging in courts is that of former petroleum minister, Diezani Alison-Madueke, whom the Nigerian government has not been able to extradite to face the money laundering charges filed against her by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) since 2018. The trial of a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, has suffered several setbacks since its commencement in February 2019, following his indictment by the legislature for an alleged U.S.$635,000 scam. Malami has insisted that the fight against corruption could only be assessed by the number of prosecutions and convictions, saying the fact that EFCC could record, over 2,000 convictions within a year showed that the present administration has done well in the fight against corruption.
