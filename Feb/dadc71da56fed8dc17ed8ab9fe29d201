A new survey has detected "shocking" declines in the populations of 22 species of eagle, vulture, buzzard, falcon and other birds of prey in Kenya - and roads, railways and rat poison have all played a part.           Populations of 19 out of 22 Kenyan birds of prey species had declined by 70% on average in just 40 years, the survey has said, with one species - the common kestrel - having declined by 95%.           Birds of prey play a key role in keeping down rats and other pests and vultures dispose of animal carcasses that can harbour deadly diseases. But being at the top of the food chain makes them highly sensitive to human impacts on the environment.           In Kenya, the development of roads, railways and power lines have fragmented many ecosystems, while deforestation, intensive agriculture and overgrazing have left "a biologically impoverished landscape," the study says. Declines were recorded among vulture and large eagle species, and were especially noticeable among once-common small and medium-sized raptors like augur buzzards and black-winged kites, the survey found. No species had increased significantly. The long-legged snake-hunting secretary bird that strides across open grassland, and the long-crested eagle, named for the long feathers that dangle from its head, had declined by 94%, writes Ryan Truscott for Radio France Internationale.
