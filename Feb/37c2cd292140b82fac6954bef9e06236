UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed has said that women had faced "unimaginable" horrors in conflict-torn regions of Ethiopia.           Mohammed became the highest-ranking UN official to visit Ethiopia since the government launched an offensive against the militants in the Tigray region in November 2020.           She was speaking to reporters in New York, a day after returning from the East African nation.           During her five-day trip, she visited the Tigray, Amhara, Afar and Somali regions in Ethiopia. She met with Tigray's leaders and Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and  President Sahle-Work Zewde. She said the warring parties "cannot achieve any lasting peace without reconciling and being held to account for the atrocities across the country." The country erupted in war after months of political tension between the Ethiopian government and Tigrayan fighters. The conflict has claimed thousands of lives and pushed hundreds of thousands into famine. Rights groups have accused fighters on all sides of widespread sexual violence, reports Deutsche Welle.
