Perpetrators responsible for recent escalating violence in the country must be held accountable, the UN Mission in the country, UNMISS, has said in a statement. Fighting between the Sudan People's Liberation Army in Opposition and armed youths, which began in Mirmir Payam, has spread to several villages in Koch, Mayiandit and Leer. The violence has been mounting over the past two weeks. Civilians have been killed, while others were injured or forced to flee their homes. Property was destroyed and humanitarian supplies were also looted in the violence. UNMISS has appealed to national and local leaders, and armed groups, to immediately stop the violence. It will also ramp up patrols and continue to work with stakeholders at the state, national and local level, as well as communities, to encourage dialogue and reduce tensions and insecurity, reports UN News Service.
