The Committee to Protect Journalists has urged Zambian authorities to immediately drop the criminal investigation into television station manager Petty Chanda and stop harassing journalists whose reporting may embarrass top officials. On January 18, privately owned Kenmark Broadcasting Network (KBN TV) aired a leaked audio conversation allegedly between Levy Ngoma, political advisor to President Hakainde Hichilema, and Joseph Akafumba, the home affairs permanent secretary. The two men were heard planning to ban the opposition Democratic Party from participating in a local by-election. Two days later, Chanda was summoned and questioned for over three hours at police headquarters in the capital Lusaka. Police spokesperson Rae Hamoonga said that Chanda's summoning and investigation was in relation to the leaked audio.
