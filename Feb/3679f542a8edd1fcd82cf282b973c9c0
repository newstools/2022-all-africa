Some members of the opposition National Unity Platform, led by leader Mathias Mpuuga, marched out in protest against injustice, and the alleged torture of Ugandan citizens. The group later sat on the stairs leading up to the parliament entrance chanting We Want Freedom and Free Our People. The protest comes days after a video in which government critic and novelist Kakwenza Rukirabashaija stripped to show the results of torture allegedly received while in detention. Rukirabashaija was also held in solitary confinement. According to the writer's lawyer, Eron Kiiza, the arrest followed after criticism via social media posts in December 2021, which were levelled at President Yoweri Museveni's son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, commander of the land forces.
