The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Chairperson Mahmood Yakubu, has announced that the presidential and national assembly elections date has been changed from February 18, 2023 to February 25, 2023. The governorship and state Houses of Assembly elections will be held on March 11, 2023. The INEC chairperson said the commission could not release the detailed "Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the General Election" as it normally would because of the pending enactment of the Electoral Reform Bill 2022, which the president signed on February 25, 2022, after much delay.
