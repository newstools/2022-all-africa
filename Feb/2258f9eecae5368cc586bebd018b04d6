West Africa's latest coup in Burkina Faso on January 24, 2022 has renewed unease about coups "returning" and democracies "dying" in Africa. The recent attempt in Guinea-Bissau, too, recalled the first decades after independence, when coups were rampant.  The latest coup in Burkina Faso is the fourth in Africa's Sahel region in less than 18 months. The other three were carried out in August 2020 in Mali, in April 2021 in Chad, and Mali's "coup within a coup" in May 2021. The re-emergence of coup d'etats on the African continent and West Africa, in particular, is mainly due to fundamental factors such as youth unemployment, corruption, and lack of transparency amongst leadership as well as the relative weakness of the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union to deal with security issues.  Across Africa, several sitting presidents have tampered with constitutional terms to stay longer in power, in just over a decade, writes Hakeem Onapajo and Muhammad Dan Suleiman for The Conversation.
