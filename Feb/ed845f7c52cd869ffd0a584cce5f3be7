Wetlands, which include marshes and peatlands, are the unsung heroes of the climate crisis. They store more carbon than any other ecosystem, with peatlands alone storing twice as much as all the world's forests. Inland wetland ecosystems, also absorb excess water and help prevent floods and drought, widely seen as critical to helping communities adapt to a changing climate, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. "Not all wetlands are permanently wet and not all wetlands are natural. Artificial wetlands, such as reservoirs and fish ponds, help cool the planet and soak up carbon. Constructed wetlands make use of the natural purification processes of vegetation, soils and microbes to remove contaminants from wastewater, and when designed right can serve as biodiversity hotspots and migration stopovers. This relatively low-cost technology improves water security, making it important for climate change adaptation".
