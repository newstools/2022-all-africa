For the first time in South African history, the State of the Nation Address (SONA) will be delivered outside the Parliament precinct, after the building was gutted in a fire in January. President Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver the SONA at the Cape Town City Hall. There are high expectations ahead of the SONA where Ramaphosa is expected to address issues of high unemployment and the struggling economy, loadshedding, corruption among others.
