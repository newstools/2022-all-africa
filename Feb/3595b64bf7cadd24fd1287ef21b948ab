Aitta Kébé and Maimouna Tamba are two women fighting against gender-based violence in Senegal. Though they are 100 km apart they are both striving to ensure that Senegalese women and girls enjoy a life free from gender-based violence. In Wolof, Bajenu means father's sister, a pillar of Senegalese society commanding trust and respect; Gox refers to the zone or location. Bajenu Gox, then, serve as local godmothers for women and girls. "We're elected by the community to be at the service of other women. To be Bajenu Gox, you must be a leader, a woman who cares deeply about others, and who can keep secrets. When women come to me, I listen and offer advice in their best interest" explains Kébé, a resident of Kaffrine in central Senegal. Tamba says she sees more than 100 cases of gender-based violence a month and some involve child marriages and early pregnancies, while others relate to sexual, physical, or verbal violence. In response, the government is intervening at the community level, says Mingué Ndiaye Gacko, head of the Gender unit in the Ministry of Health and Social Action. In October 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) helped organize three training sessions on supporting victims of gender-based violence in the regions of Kaffrine, Kaolack, and Sédhiou. Among the over 100 participants were regional Bajenu Gox, district medical staff and social workers.
