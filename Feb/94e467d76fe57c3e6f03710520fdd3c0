As Kenyans approach a general election in August 2022, many lack confidence in the electoral process.           According to a national opinion poll conducted by Afrobarometer in 2019, only 29.2% of Kenyans thought that the country's 2017 election was free and fair. Another 33.5% thought that there were minor problems, 12% that there were major problems, and 21.7% that the elections were not free and fair at all.           Moreover, according to a 2021 poll commissioned by South Consulting, although around half of Kenyans have confidence in the electoral commission to support a free and fair election, around half also believe that the government's favoured candidate will win, no matter how people vote.           Despite this scepticism, a majority of Kenyans will likely still turn out to vote as they have done in previous polls. This isn't to say that voter apathy is not an issue. It is, and contributed to the electoral commission's ability to register only 25% of its target in last year's mass voter registration drive and about 23% of its target this year. When it comes to rigging, it's tempting to think of ballot fraud as things done to unsuspecting citizens by wily politicians. In reality, it has been found that   found that processes are sometimes co-produced. 'Over-voting' in a candidate's strongholds, for example, usually takes place with the complicity of some community members, writes Gabrielle Lynch, Justin Willis and Nic Cheeseman for The Conversation.
