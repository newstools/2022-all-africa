In the wake of World Cancer Day, Africa's struggle against the disease has seen a notable need for treatment for nations across the continent. The number of cancer cases is notably on the rise in sub-Saharan Africa. But medical professionals say there is not enough awareness, facilities, or political will to change the situation, writes Martina Schwikowski for Deutsche Welle. German oncologist Oliver Henke says that an estimated 30% of all cancer cases in sub-Saharan Africa are caused or exacerbated by infections. Above all, this includes cervical cancer, which is usually the result of a long-term Human Papilloma Virus infection. A Tunisian study also highlights that lung cancer is on the rise in northern and southern Africa. In South Africa, this type of cancer caused the most deaths in 2018, according to the The Cancer Genome Atlas. Meanwhile, Nigeria requires at least 300 radiotherapy machines to effectively address the gaps in cancer treatment in the country. Kenya is among seven Africa countries set to benefit from life-saving nuclear medicine and radiotherapy, an initiative of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The initiative aims at helping African countries tackle the shortage of cancer care capacity in continuous efforts to reduce cancer-linked deaths in the continent.
