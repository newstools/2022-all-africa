The World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has fought hard for vaccine equity in the battle against Covid-19. On February 11, 2022 a visit to an mRNA vaccine technology transfer hub in South Africa will add a piece to the jigsaw puzzle which has to be built to achieve that. Tedros will join Belgium's Minister of Development Cooperation, Meryame Kitir, on the high-level visit to Cape Town.  Since the start of the pandemic, Africa's capacity to manage Covid-19 cases has gradually improved, with the increased availability of trained health workers, oxygen and other medical supplies. However, despite the improvements, oxygen availability remains a concern, and a large majority of patients who require oxygen as part of their clinical treatment plan are unable to access it, according to the WHO. Meanwhile, the WHO's Regional Director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti, says 11% of the African population is fully vaccinated, while 85% have not received a single dose.
