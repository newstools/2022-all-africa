This year marks the 20th anniversary of the founding of the African Union (AU) as a successor to the Organization of African Unity. The summit's theme is "Building resilience in nutrition on the African continent: Accelerate the human capital, social and economic development". According to the Institute for Security Studies, "several conflict flashpoints are expected to be addressed and among the most pressing is the conflict in Ethiopia, which has plunged the host of the AU into crisis and political uncertainty." African leaders should give priority to addressing the rampant abuses occurring in the conflict in Ethiopia between fighters affiliated with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and the Ethiopian federal government and its allies, including Eritrea. The conflict, now ongoing for more than a year, is having a devastating impact on civilians, report reports UN News Service. Beyond the Ethiopian crisis, civilians have been the target of attack elsewhere on the continent. Armed Islamist groups, government forces, and allied militia fighters killed at least 800 civilians during attacks across the Sahel region in 2021. About 700,000 children are out of school in Cameroon's Anglophone regions due to attacks by armed separatist groups. In the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the government's imposition of military rule to address insecurity in the region has not improved civilian protection. More than 1,900 civilians have been killed since the start of martial law in May 2021.             In Mozambique, the Islamic State (ISIS)-linked insurgent group has committed numerous grave abuses, including indiscriminate attacks against civilians, kidnappings, and sexual violence. Government forces have also been implicated in serious abuses, including threats and unlawful use of force against civilians, reports the Human Rights Watch.  The Covid-19 pandemic, the increasing threats of insecurity from conflicts and terrorism, and the socio-economic development on the continent will also be a focus.
