In a shocking move, the suspended Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) board has formally applied to FIFA for sanctions on local football following what they call a continued interference of the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) in the running of the game in the country. The SRC, a government organisation, was given until January 3 to lift the suspension against the Felton Kamambo-led executive by the world football body but failed to heed the instruction until now. Kamambo was invited to be part of the AFCON Cup final between Senegal and Egypt but was not allowed to leave the country due to his ongoing court case where he is accused of alleged vote buying ahead of the elections which got him into office. However, Kamambo's critics believe the call for sanctions shows desperation to cling on to power by the Kamambo ZIFA-led board.
