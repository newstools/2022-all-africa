The Federation of Zimbabwe Educators Union (FOZEU) has said its members are incapacitated to report for duty when schools reopen on February 7 because their meagre salaries have been eroded. Having met on February 1, teachers' unions decided that educators will not report to work on the proposed schools opening date. FOZEU also urged the government to meet the demands of the teachers by restoring the value of teachers' salaries back to U.S.$540 and enhance the capacity of schools to function well under the Covid-19 pandemic. For years, teachers have been arguing that their salaries have been reduced to nothing due to high inflation. Zimbabwe's economy has been on a downturn for over a decade characterized by scarcity of foreign currency. President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took over from Robert Mugabe, pledged to revive the country's economy but economic woes which plagued the late former president Robert Mugabe's rule have persisted.
