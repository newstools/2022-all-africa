The U.S has announced a reward of U.S.$5 million for any leads on Joseph Kony, leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, so that he can answer for crimes against humanity, committed by him and his followers in northern Uganda. In the 1990s, Kony waged war against the government. The conflict saw thousands of northern Ugandans killed, maimed and displaced from their homes. Over two million people were confined to camps for internally displaced persons in northern Uganda, in a two-decade-long insurgency by the Lord's Resistance Army. Citizens have slowly returned to their homes after Kony and his rebel group fled to the Central African Republic after been driven out by the Ugandan military. The U.S. government has said it has been looking for Kony for over 15 years, but all previous efforts to arrest him did not materialise.
