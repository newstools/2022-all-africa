Parents and pregnant women globally are exposed to aggressive marketing for baby formula milk, according to a report launched jointly by two UN agencies.           How Marketing of Formula Milk Iinfluences Our Decisions on Infant Feeding - the first report in a series by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) - draws on interviews with parents, pregnant women, and health workers in eight countries.           UNICEF and WHO maintain that the U.S.$55 billion formula milk industry uses systematic and unethical marketing strategies to influence parents' infant feeding decisions and exploitative practices that compromise child nutrition and violate international commitments. The report found not only that industry marketing techniques include unregulated and invasive online targeting, but also sponsored advice networks and helplines; offered promotions and free gifts; and influenced health workers' training and recommendations. While global breastfeeding rates have increased very little over the past two decades, formula milk sales have more than doubled in roughly the same time. And alarmingly, the report notes that the baby feeding industry has approached health workers across all countries with promotional gifts, research funding and even sales commissions to influence new mothers on their feeding choices, reports UN News Service.
