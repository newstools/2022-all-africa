Lusaka residents have complained and expressed fear about the increased piles of uncollected garbage in the city especially in the CBD and around townships, as it could lead to the outbreak of water-borne diseases such as Cholera. With an estimated population of 2,500,000, Lusaka produces about 1,200 tonnes of waste every day. Lusaka's biggest waste disposal site Chunga, receives only about 40% of this waste daily, according to the latest report on the status of waste management in Lusaka. Due to the increased number of vendors, the generation of organic waste has increased, making it very difficult for local authorities to manage.
