Blessing Okagbare-Otegheri, 33, was Nigeria's hope for a gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games but was suspended for testing positive in a drugs test taken in Slovenia in July 2021, in which human growth hormone was found. Okgabare-Otegheri holds the Olympic and World Championship records for long jump, and is a world medalist in the 200 metres. She also holds the women's 100 metres Commonwealth Games record for the fastest time at 10.85 seconds. The athlete will approach the Court of Arbitration for Sports in Lausanne Switzerland, to appeal the ban slapped on her by the Athletics Integrity Unit.
