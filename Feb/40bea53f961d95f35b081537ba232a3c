An Ikeja High Court on February 25, 2022 sentenced kidnap kingpin Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike - also known as Evans - to life imprisonment for kidnapping Donatus Dunu, the chief executive officer of Maydon Pharmaceuticals Ltd in 2017. Five people were arraigned alongside Evans, but the court found only two of the defendants, Uche Amadi and Okwuchukwu Nwachukwu guilty. An employee of the pharmaceutical firm testified in 2018 that a ransom of U.S.$260,000 was paid to the kidnappers for Dunu's release - but that he had not been freed.  Dunu was held for three months before escaping and telling police where Evans was hiding.  Justice Hakeem Oshodi said during sentencing that the men showed no remorse for their crimes and that a lesson needed to be taught. The gang has been linked to various other kidnappings. According to NAN, this is the first judgment delivered in the five kidnapping trials Evans is facing at various high courts in Lagos State.
