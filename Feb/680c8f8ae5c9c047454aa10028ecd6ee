As the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation was marked on 6 February, the UN estimates that 200 million women and girls around the world have undergone FGM, with 80% of cases occurring in Africa alone. Most of the girls who have undergone this practice are below 15 years of age. The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the risk of female genital mutilation continuing unfettered, with the UN predicting that an additional two million girls will be victimized in the next ten years. Prolonged school closures have provided cover for girls recovering from FGM. In addition, movement restrictions have prevented campaigners against FGM from accessing some villages. The United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, has said with an estimated 19.9 million survivors, Nigeria accounts for the third-highest number of women and girls who have undergone Female Genital Mutilation, FGM, globally. In Somalia, over 90% or more of girls and women, have been subjected to female genital mutilation. Despite the practice having devastating health ramifications for women and girls - including pain, bleeding, permanent disability, and even death - discussion over how to end the harmful tradition, remains taboo. FGM involves the partial or total removal of external female genitalia or other injuries to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. The practice has no health benefits for girls and women.
