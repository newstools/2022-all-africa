Nigeria was thrown into darkness after the national electricity grid suffered a system collapse on March 14 - the second such occurrence in 2022. The grid is infamous for experiencing disruptions - it collapsed in February, May, July and August 2021, writes Leadership. The development comes as Nigerians are experiencing a breakdown in power supply and a hike in fuel prices. Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu and major stakeholders in the Nigeria electricity supply sector, are engaged in sessions to find lasting solutions to the perennial power crisis. The minister said: "we must find a solution so that Nigerians will have electricity. I want us to have the patience to talk to each other, not blaming each other." The country has been having electricity supply challenges for many years.
