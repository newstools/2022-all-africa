Liberia is marking the country's founding as an independent nation in 1822 when the first group of previously enslaved African Americans arrived from the United States. The government says the year-long bicentennial commemoration is intended "to reclaim Liberia's leadership role in Pan-Africanism" and deepen U.S.-Liberia historic ties, while forging stronger economic and social bonds between both peoples. Two high-level U.S. visits - one representing Preisdnet Biden and the second a seven-member delegation from the U.S. House - have underscored the ups and downs of the long bilateral ties.
