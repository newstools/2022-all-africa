The UN and other humanitarian organisations in Malawi have launched a flash appeal for U.S.$29.4 million to provide assistance for the next three months to those hit hardest by Tropical Storm Ana in Malawi. The appeal focuses on the six hardest-hit districts where an estimated 680,000 people need humanitarian assistance and protection according to the UN team in Malawi. Forty-four organisations are making the appeal, including the Malawi Red Cross, seven national NGOs, 26 international NGOs and 10 UN agencies. Government figures show that over 990,000 people were affected in 17 of the country's 28 districts. Tropical Storm Ana caused widespread destruction and triggered flooding across southeast Africa. Fatalities were reported in several countries including Mozambique, Malawi and Uganda.
