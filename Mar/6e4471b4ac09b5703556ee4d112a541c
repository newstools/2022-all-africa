Kenyans, along with civil society members and security experts have expressed alarm over the resurgence of political gangs and militias in the country ahead of the August 9, 2022 elections. Speaking during a virtual meeting hosted by Counter Terrorism Policing Kenya, the participants said that despite efforts by successive governments to crack down on them, these gangs have grown in size and influence in the country. They attributed the situation to the high rate of unemployment amongst the youth and corruption within security intelligence services. According to one participant, some politicians sometimes use these gangs to eliminate their opponents noting that during the 2013 and 2017 elections, some bloggers and rivals went missing which he attributed to the hunger for power, reports Bruhan Makong for Capital FM.
