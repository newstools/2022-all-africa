For thousands of years, the oil palm - indigenous to West Africa - has had an intimate relationship with people. An explosive expansion of oil palm groves throughout western and central Africa in the wake of a dry period around 2,500 years ago enabled human migration and agricultural development; in turn, humans facilitated oil palm propagation through seed dispersal and slash-and-burn agriculture, writes Pauline Von Hellermann for The Conversation.  Palm oil has long been a staple food in a region stretching from Senegal to Angola along Africa's western coast. By 1840, palm oil was cheap enough to completely replace tallow or whale oil in such products as soap and candles. Today there are enough oil palm plantations worldwide, and the industry is still growing. It is concentrated in Asia, but plantations are spreading in Africa and Latin America. A 2019 investigation of one company in the DR Congo found dangerous conditions and abusive labor practices that echoed colonial-era palm oil projects.
