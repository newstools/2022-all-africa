Heavily armed men suspected to be bandits attacked the Kaduna International Airport, killing a security guard and temporarily halting air traffic. The airport officials have said that the attackers, numbering over 200, entered the airport premises through a perimeter fence from a nearby forest and started shooting sporadically to scare workers.  Armed gangs have been terrorising the state for years. In the last few weeks, dozens of people were reportedly  killed in a series of attacks on local communities south of the state, where sectarian violence has persisted. In 2015, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari vowed to address security concerns and boost the country's economy. But authorities have been struggling to curb frequent attacks by armed gangs, which has been on the increase with mass kidnapping of students and the killing of local residents, since late 2020.
