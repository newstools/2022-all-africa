In a development that presents a major public health threat to malaria-endemic countries as well as the ongoing global elimination efforts, parasites are becoming resistant to the methods used for malaria diagnosis, the World Health Organisation has said.  But the international public health body says there are steps that can be taken to avoid a worse case scenario. These include improving surveillance, responding quickly to diagnostic resistance, finding alternative diagnostic methods, and global and national cooperation. However, the new alternative tests are expensive, not readily available and are often less sensitive. Malaria continues to have devastating impact on poor people, especially in Africa. To fight the disease, countries primarily use insecticide-treated bed nets to control the mosquitoes that transmit malaria parasites, or medicines to treat malaria patients. These measures have been highly effective over the years. But now they are threatened by mosquitoes resisting the insecticides, and parasites resisting the drug treatments.
