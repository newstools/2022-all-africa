More than one thousand community members in Northern Tanzania have gathered to protest against the government's plan to evict people of Loliondo from their ancestral land. According to International Land Coalition-Africa, more than 73,000 Indigenous peoples from Loliondo, and about 90,000 in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, face eviction to make way for elite tourism and trophy hunting.           The government plans to lease Ngorongoro Conservation Area, home to over one million wildebeest and the endangered black rhino, to hunting company Otterlo Business Corporation, which apparently belongs to the royal family in the United Arab Emirates.
