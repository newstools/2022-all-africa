Uganda and Burundi have held their first-ever business forum in an effort to bolster relations between the two countries to encourage trade, which up until now, has been done on an informal basis, said Uganda's lands minister Judith Nabakooba, who represented the Ugandan minister for trade.  Nabakooba said that in 2009, the country exported goods worth U.S.$82 million and this grew to U.S.$92 million in 2012. By 2021 Uganda's exports were at U.S.$50 million from U.S.$37.03 million in 2019. During the forum, Uganda opened a new three-storey building to house the country's Chancery at its embassy in Bujumbura, the Burundian capital. To further strengthen ties, Uganda Airlines will increase its flights from four times a week, to six times a week to Bujumbura.
