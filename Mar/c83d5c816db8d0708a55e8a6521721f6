The U.S.$301 million development at the River Club site in Observatory, Cape Town has been stopped, with a court ruling that the developers must "consult meaningfully" with all affected people, writes Tania Broughton for GroundUp. Indigenous Khoi and San people went to court to block construction of the planned African headquarters for online retail giant Amazon. Opponents say the project will ruin a historically significant riverside site in Cape Town and harm the environment. "We're in a situation where a terrain that is so sacred to the people of our country is not just under threat, but being damaged and destroyed as we speak," said Tauriq Jenkins, high commissioner of the Goringhaicona Khoi Khoin Indigenous Traditional Council (GKKITC), which is among the groups fighting the project. The GKKITC previously filed an interdict against the construction along the Liesbeek River. This was in opposition to the The First Nations Collective, a fellow group of Khoisan members, who support the initiative.
