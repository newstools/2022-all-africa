The greater Kafue National Park and West Lunga ecosystem complex was once home to an abundance of ancient rosewood trees and a host of other endemic and endangered species. Around half of the population in the surrounding area live in extreme poverty. Few jobs, leave communities dependent on the forest for food, fuel and income, driving deforestation, making the West Lunga landscape the third-most deforested in the country. But a community-driven initiative brings hope.
