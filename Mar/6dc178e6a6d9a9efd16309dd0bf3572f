The government has embarked on a campaign to reduce the use of charcoal and firewood, starting with large consumers that include educational institutions, hospitals and prisons. The Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) has signed a memorandum of understanding with the country's prison services, with the aim of transiting from the use of biomass, to clean energy - in a project called Charcoal to Power. More than 200 prisons across the country will benefit from the pilot project, as they are an institution that uses around 30,000 tonnes of firewood a year for cooking, which translates to around U.S.$277 million. ERA is targeting over 500 institutions and 50,000 households before they roll out the campaign in the rest of the country.
