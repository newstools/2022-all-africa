The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is appealing for U.S.$205 million to provide assistance to more than 1.6 million people displaced by conflict in northern Ethiopia. The conflict, which began 16 months ago in northern Ethiopia's Tigray region, has spread to the neighbouring Amhara and Afar regions. This has resulted in a humanitarian crisis for more than 2 million people, forced to flee their homes. UNHCR says most of the victims are displaced inside Ethiopia, while nearly 60,000 have fled to neighbouring Sudan. UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said all those who fled are in desperate need of support. Ethiopia launched its military offensive in Tigray on November 4, 2020, to oust the Tigray People's Liberation Front from its northern stronghold. The UN says 40% of Tigray's population of 6 million suffers from acute hunger, with 400,000 on the verge of famine. Eritrea, which supports the Ethiopian government, has reportedly attacked several camps in Tigray holding tens of thousands of Eritrean refugees, reports Lisa Schlein for Voice of America.
