State prosecutors from 11 East African countries have vowed to tighten their cross border cooperation and tackle money laundering crimes, to combat wildlife crimes and other emerging transnational crimes. The commitment was made during the closing of the East Africa Association of Prosecutors' (EAAP) technical committee meeting in Nairobi, Kenya. The partnership is expected to strip wildlife traffickers of their ill-gotten gains, disrupt networks, and send the message that wildlife crimes won't prevail. EAAP members include Burundi, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. Javier Montano, the Regional Coordinator at the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has also hailed the partnership of East African countries to come together and tackle wildlife crimes, reports Bertrand Byishimo for New Times.
