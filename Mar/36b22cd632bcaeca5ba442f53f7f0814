Netflix is set to launch a five-part docu-series titled Senzo: Murder of a Soccer Star to unpack the unresolved murder of Senzo Meyiwa. The news of the murder of the popular goalkeeper made headlines in 2014 when he was shot and killed in an alleged botched robbery at the Vosloorus home of his girlfriend, popular actress and musician Kelly Khumalo. There were six eyewitnesses at the scene, including some of his closest friends. In the docu-series, Meyiwa's family, investigators, key witnesses, and sports commentators aim to unpack the truth behind this high-profile murder. In 2019, Senzo's father Samuel Meyiwa, passed away after a stroke, which his family says was caused by grief and stress. The investigation into his murder has proven to be extremely taxing for his loved ones and fans alike, as his alleged killers were only arrested in 2021. Eight years later, the murder has still not been solved.
