The National Lotteries Commission (NLC) has applied for an urgent court order to force Minister of Trade and Industry Ebrahim Patel to appoint a new board or extend the term of current board members, writes Raymond Joseph for GroundUp. Alternatively, the NLC wants Patel to extend the terms of the three remaining board members until a new board is appointed. This is the latest round of litigation by the NLC against Patel, who has oversight over the Lottery. In another current court action, the NLC petitioned the Supreme Court of Appeal for leave to appeal a High Court ruling confirming Patel's power to investigate corruption involving the Commission.
