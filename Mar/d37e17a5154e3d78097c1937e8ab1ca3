The U.S. government has issued a bounty of up to U.S.$5 million for information on the whereabouts of Jehad Serwan Mostafa, alias Ahmed Gurey, believed be a high-ranking member of the Somalia-based militant group Al-Shabaab.           The U.S. said that Mostafa, 41 who is on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists List, lived and graduated from college in San Diego, California, before moving to Somalia in 2005.           "With Al-Shabaab, Mostafa has functioned in many critical capacities, including serving as a military instructor at the group's training camps, leading foreign fighters, operating in the group's media wing, acting as an intermediary between Al-Shabaab and other terrorist organizations, and leading the group's use of explosives in terrorist attacks," the  U.S. State Department said.  The Pentagon is in the meantime considering sending more U.S. troops to Somalia, after a withdrawal was ordered by former president, Donald Trump.
