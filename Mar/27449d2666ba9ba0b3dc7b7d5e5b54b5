Following the significant decline in piracy attacks in Nigerian waters - put at 77% - following the Nigerian Navy's increased counter security operations against maritime criminality, oil theft and other attacks, the International Maritime Bureau has exited Nigeria from its Piracy List, writes Kingsley Ononobi for Vanguard. The Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo said: "As you are all aware, the Nigerian Navy (NN) is the cardinal institution in the maritime sector that has the responsibility to lead the national response and prosecution of maritime threats. I make bold to say that the NN made giant strides in ensuring the security of the nation's maritime environment." The Nigerian navy has also been involved in joint operations with countries like the UK, France and Italy to protect cargo ships from attacks by pirates in the Gulf of Guinea over the past few months.
