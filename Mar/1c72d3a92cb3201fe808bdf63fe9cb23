A train crash in south-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has killed at least 60 people, the state rail company and local sources have said. The train was a freight service which had reportedly been carrying "several hundred stowaways," even though this was prohibited. The train was made up of 15 wagons, 12 of which were empty, and was coming from Luen in a neighboring province destined for the mining town of Tenke, close to Kolwezi. Train derailments are common in the country, as are shipwrecks of overloaded boats on the country's lakes and rivers. Due to the lack of passenger trains or passable roads, people use goods trains to travel long distances, reports Voice of America.
