Years of fighting between separatists and the state in Cameroon have hit women hard, uprooting hundreds of thousands. Fighting triggered by power struggles within the separatist movement have caused an undetermined number of casualties.           Separatists have been accused of abducting teachers at a school for children with disabilities. Videos on social medis show schools torched. A December 2021 Human Rights Watch report says Cameroon separatists attack schools, train children as fighters and have deprived at least 700,000 children from having education since 2017.           Human Rights Watch also says government troops organized abusive counterinsurgencies that affected education. Thousands of children have fled the English-speaking regions to safer French-speaking towns for education.           International Crisis Group has called on the government and external partners to step up aid for the displaced. It says donors should start planning now for including women activists in future peace talks.
