The Ugandan government has failed to hold to account security officials, who have unlawfully detained and tortured hundreds of government critics, opposition supporters, peaceful protesters, and others, Human Rights Watch has said in a report. The 98-page report - "I Only Need Justice: Unlawful Detention and Abuse in Unauthorized Places of Detention in Uganda - documents enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests, unlawful detention, torture, and other ill-treatment by the police, army, military intelligence, and Uganda's domestic intelligence body, the Internal Security Organisation (ISO). Most of the abuses took place in unlawful places of detention - "safe houses" -  in 2018, 2019, and around the time of the January 2021 general elections. The lobby group is calling on the government of Uganda to immediately close all so-called safe houses and other unauthorised detention centres or bring them promptly to court to face charges.
