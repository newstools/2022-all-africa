A virtual gallery to showcase Mali's cultural history has been launched, featuring tens of thousands of Timbuktu's ancient manuscripts. The collection was put together by search engine Google, along with local and international partners. The project known as Mali Magic, has created a gallery containing up to 40,000 pages now available online, covering topics from maths, astrological charts, biology to music. The manuscripts were smuggled to safety from Timbuktu after Islamist militant groups took control of the city in northern Mali in 2012. In 2016 an alleged member of an Islamist group, Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi, was found guilty by the International Criminal Court, for intentionally ordering attacks on religious and historic buildings in Timbuktu. He was sentenced to nine years in jail and apologised for his actions. The ancient manuscripts of Timbuktu represent the long legacy of written knowledge and academic excellence in Africa and hold the potential to inspire global learning from the actions of the past in confronting modern-day issues.
