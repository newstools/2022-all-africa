AllAfrica.com held a webinar on March 7, 2022 to commemorate International Women's Day celebrated worldwide on March 8. The webinar centred around the UN's theme - "Equality Today for a Sustainable Future". The gathering by the  AllAfrica team, was aimed at enabling African women to access decision-making bodies, to realise their full potential and have sustainable and inclusive responses to the impact of climate change.           Specialists from various backgrounds unanimously agreed that "the time has come to translate the discourse on the promotion of women's rights into concrete actions". This can only be achieved by their access to decision-making bodies or their presence at the table where their rights are negotiated. To this, the panellists added the opportunities offered by innovative tools such as the African Continental Free Trade Area, which, according to the Economic Commission for Africa, is a vector of gender equality towards the achievement of the Agenda 2030 and Agenda 2063.           To get to the top, the panellists said that not only must girls know that there is no limit, but that they need to show commitment, resilience, passion and generosity to deliver the best of themselves to humanity and their society.
