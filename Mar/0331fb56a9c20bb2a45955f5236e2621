Getting a new passport is quick and easy in many African countries. But, in others, thousands of people spend a long time waiting for their papers - often simply because there aren't enough blank books. More urgent and expensive requests often take even longer. Several African countries work with Belgian company Semlex to produce biometric passports. The investigative reporting network Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), took a closer look at these relationships and exposed a litany of corrupt practices in 2020. Semlex allegedly paid an influential government official in Madagascar at least U.S.$150,000 before the company was commissioned to produce passports for the country. In 2020, the DR Congo cancelled a deal with Semlex that offered passports for U.S.$$185 a piece in one of the poorest countries in the world, reports David Ehl for Deutsche Welle.
