Farmer groups have warned of foods shortages in Ziimbabwe owing to the prolonged dry spell currently being experienced in the country. This comes after the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (Fewsnet) warned the drought could result in poor harvests. Higher temperatures and a reduction in rainfall have reduced already depleted water resources, contributing to an increasing number of droughts. Earlier, UN scientists delivered a stark warning about the impact of climate change on people and the planet, saying that ecosystem collapse, species extinction, deadly heatwaves and floods are among the "unavoidable multiple climate hazards" the world will face over the next two decades due to global warming. According to the report, human-induced climate change is causing dangerous and widespread disruption in nature and affecting billions of lives all over the world, despite efforts to reduce the risks, with people and ecosystems least able to cope.
