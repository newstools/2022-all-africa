Ethiopian authorities have pledged to prosecute individuals who apparently set a man alight - an incident widely circulated on social media. Some of the people seen in the video were wearing Ethiopian army uniforms.           The incident is said to have occurred in the Benishangul-Gumuz region of northwest Ethiopia.  In a statement on March 12, 2022, Tigrayan leaders described the incident as "barbaric". They accused "Amhara expansionists and their cronies" of carrying out atrocities against ethnic Tigrayans living in Benishangul-Gumuz.           Both sides in the Tigray conflict are accused of committing rights abuses.
