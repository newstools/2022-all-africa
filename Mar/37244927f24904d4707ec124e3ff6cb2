About a hundred people have marched to Parliament on Human Rights Day to ask the government to intervene in ongoing xenophobic attacks and campaigns against foreign nationals, writes Tariro Washinyira for GroundUp. The march was organised by the Concerned Citizens of the Western Cape and according to their memo and was endorsed by 15 organisations. The group calls for the immediate arrest and prosecution of those who use threats and violence against foreign nationals working mostly in the informal sector. "When the South African government is faced with failure, it diverts attention to immigrants so that we start to fight our brothers who are also facing the same social economic ills," says activist Nandi Vanqa-Mgijima. Between 2020 and 2021, the Institute for Security Studies recorded high incidents of violence against African and Asian-born migrants in South Africa. At the time, members of the African National Congress's uMkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association demanded that 'undocumented illegals' leave the country and that jobs and businesses be reserved for South Africans.
