The recent party nomination of Deputy president William Ruto as a presidential candidate sets the stage for a tight race in elections scheduled for early August 2022.           Ruto, 55, is leader of the United Democratic Alliance party, the newly formed and largest party in Kenya, under the Kwanza (Kenya First) coalition. His main rival is Raila Odinga, 77, who will run under the rival Azimio la Umoja (Unity Declaration) coalition.           Against sustained pushback by incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta, Ruto is determined to succeed him. Kenyatta is instead backing his former archrival and longtime opposition leader Raila Odinga.           Kenyatta and Ruto are former allies - Ruto campaigned for Kenyatta during his first presidential attempt in 2002, which he lost. Both were indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) as the suspected masterminds of the mass atrocities that followed the disputed 2007 elections. They then teamed up to contest in 2013. They prevailed in 2017 as well, but not before the Supreme Court annulled the first round. The stakes are high for Kenyans. A Ruto victory could end the dynastic dominance of Kenya's politics and economy. Peripheral players could rise. As to whether Ruto would prise open the economy for the benefit of all, that remains an open question, reports Westen K Shilaho for The Conversation.
