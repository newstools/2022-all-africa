A revolt is brewing at the South African Football Association (SAFA), writes Jo-Mangaliso Mdhlela for Daily Maverick. This comes amid an investigation into the embattled soccer body, involving the South African Police's special investigative unit, the Hawks and the Master of the High Court. SAFA president, Danny Jordaan, is fighting for his survival as some of his colleagues, some suspended, some removed, accuse him of corrupting the organisation and causing it to lose its intended focus, direction, and credibility. One of the chief accusations Jordaan faces has been his inflation of the sale value of the Fun Valley Project with the alleged aim of personal benefit, according to suspended former NEC member, Malesele "Willie" Mooka. "At this stage the prosecution has requested information from persons of interest in order to ascertain their various degrees of involvement in benefiting from the SAFA account. This matter is a prosecution-led investigation. As and when there are arrests to be communicated, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation will do so," Hawks spokesperson Colonel Katlego Mogale said.
