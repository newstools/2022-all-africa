The U.S. has extended sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by one year and accused the county's leaders of economic mismanagement and undermining democratic processes or institutions.  In a statement on March 3, U.S. President Joe Biden said his administration will continue with the embargo for a further year saying President Emmerson Mnangagwa's regime is implementing policies that threaten America's foreign policy.  "The actions and policies of certain members of the Zimbabwe government and other persons to undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States," Biden said. In 2002 and 2003, the U.S. imposed targeted measures on the Government of Zimbabwe, including financial and visa sanctions against selected individuals, a ban on transfers of defence items and services, and a suspension of non-humanitarian government-to-government assistance. The U.S. says the sanctions were in response to widespread, government-sponsored violence that threatened regional security.
