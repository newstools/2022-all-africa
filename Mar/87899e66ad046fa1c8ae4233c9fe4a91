The U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has announced a visa restriction policy on the issuing of visas for those believed to be responsible for, or complicit in undermining the democratic process in Somalia. According to Blinken, the U.S. government will evaluate additional actions under this policy and other tools at it's disposal, to promote accountability and to support Somalia's democratic process. Following the failure to meet another self-established deadline of February 25, 2022 for completion of parliamentary elections, the National Consultative Council extended the deadline to March 15, 2022. Dozens of parliamentary seats are still unfilled and there is no clear plan to conclude the process. Procedural irregularities and partisan use of security forces have undermined an electoral process that is more than a year behind schedule. Journalists and opposition party members working to support democratic institutions and transparent processes, have been targeted with harassment, intimidation, arrest, and violence, according to Blinken. The U.S. government is urging Somalia to rapidly complete its parliamentary and presidential elections in a transparent and credible manner.
