A national conference in Burkina Faso has adopted a charter that will allow the Jjunta that seized power in the West African state in January, 2022 to lead a 3-year transition. The conference approved the charter, which was later signed by Junta leader Lt. Colonel Henri-Paul Damiba on March 1, 2022 after a day-long debate in the capital Ouagadougou.           Burkina Faso - alongside neighbours Mali and Niger - is struggling to contain attacks by armed militants linked to Al Qaeda and Islamic State, who have killed thousands of people and displaced hundreds of thousands in the West Africa Sahel area, rendering swathes of territories ungovernable and weakening governments.           Junta leader Damiba replaced former president Roch Marc Christian Kabore in late January, 2022 because he felt Kabore did not do enough to combat terrorism.
