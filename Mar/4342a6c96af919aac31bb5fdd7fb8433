The military seized power from previous president Alpha Condé in a coup in September 2021. Since then there has been pressure from the regional body ECOWAS to return the country to civilian rule.           Interim President, Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, announced on December 31, 2021 that a conference would take place and would be about "forgiveness, truth, and also reconciliation". While he did not explain how this will be implemented, experts and civil society organisations agree that the conference should implement a report's 2016 recommendations of a Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission. They are of the opinion that this approach would be "more productive".           Now, the national conference on the political way forward for Guinea, has been initiated by the ministry of territorial administration and decentralization, with the aim of building a "new institutional framework".           Several associations and organisations have set conditions for their participation in these meetings. Camp Boiro Victims Association for example believe that the 2016 report must be updated to take into account all the violence in the country from 1958 to the present.
