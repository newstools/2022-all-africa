It is alleged that the Mali army and armed Islamist groups have killed at least 107 civilians in central and southwestern Mali since December 2021, Human Rights Watch has said. Most of the victims - many of whom were traders, village chiefs, religious leaders and children - were executed.           "There has been a dramatic spike in the number of civilians, including suspects, killed by the Mali army and armed Islamist groups," said Corinne Dufka, Sahel director at Human Rights Watch. "This complete disregard for human life, which includes apparent war crimes, should be investigated and those found to be implicated, appropriately punished."           The group is calling on Mali's transitional government to conduct credible and impartial criminal investigations into these alleged killings, of which at least 71 were linked to government forces and 36 to armed Islamist groups, known as jihadists. Both sides should end the abuses and ensure respect for the laws of war, which are applicable to Mali's armed conflict.
