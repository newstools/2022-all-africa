Water. Where to find it, store it drink it and save more of it has been a challenge that humanity has grappled with for ages. But as the effects of the climate crisis worsen, water becomes even more precious. The World Water Forum is being held in Dakar, Senegal - a first for the continent - and UNICEF says that "if current progress trends continue, very few African Union member states may achieve universal access to safely managed drinking water, safely managed sanitation or basic hygiene services by 2030." While some experts advocate using groundwater, this is not without risks.
