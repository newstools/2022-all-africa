AllAfrica Global Media Group is organising a virtual panel on the theme Gender Equality For A Sustainable Future. This event scheduled for on Monday, March 7, 2022, from 12pm as in previous years, is a way for our platform on Africa to celebrate International Women's Day.           This day of reflection dedicated to the rights of women and their development in today's society is an opportunity to recall the importance of their participation, which is more than necessary for the development of Africa.           For this edition, allAfrica.com highlights the challenges of climate change for women in rural areas, in this case women farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Participants and panelists will have the opportunity to demonstrate how gender equality can help strengthen the resilience of African countries by giving women access to land - in line with the reflection undertaken by the UN with a view to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.
