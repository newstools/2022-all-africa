Authorities have arbitrarily detained two government critics since mid-2021 on dubious charges, Human Rights Watch has said. Lawyers for Abraham Chol Akech and Kuel Aguer Kuel filed court petitions in February 2022 because they have been detained for months without appearing before a judge. Akech was arrested in July 2021 for proclaiming that the government would be overthrown that month. Kuel was arrested in August 2021 for co-founding an alleged "anti-government movement." Neither men has been presented before court to be formally charged, or to have their detention reviewed pending trial. Their detentions are typical of a longstanding pattern of unlawful detentions and expose persistent weaknesses in the criminal justice system, Human Rights Watch said. Lawyers representing the two men raised concerns that they are being held without trial due to political interference by the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs. They said that the prosecuting authorities have been very slow to carry out investigations and believe they are abusing their discretionary power about whether to take cases forward. Authorities have previously brought trumped-up charges relating to crimes against the State and other charges against outspoken critics to stifle dissent. Trials that followed were usually plagued by due process concerns and fair trial violations, and the authorities have ignored detainees' reports of human rights violations in custody, reports Human Rights Watch.
