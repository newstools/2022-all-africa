"As we enter the remaining 12 months of the transitional period, we are mindful of the accumulation of unfulfilled commitments and the imperative to address them in the limited time at hand," said Nicholas Haysom, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for South Sudan, and head of the UN mission there, known as UNMISS.           The dire economic situation has also resulted in a surge in criminality and xenophobic hostility towards humanitarians and peacekeepers, Haysom said. Noting that sub-national violence continues to spread in some parts of the country, the Special Representative cited both perennial conflicts and emerging conflicts that span the borders of the country's states and regions.           Haysom warned that the country's overall humanitarian needs are projected to continue growing in 2022 - the third consecutive year of flooding - as the situation continues to be exacerbated by insecurity and the prolonged impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
