Headlines all around the world focus on climate projections about rising sea levels and high temperatures - but we rarely discuss how girls and women are most hit by climate change. Women have been shown to be more vulnerable to climate change impacts than men due to a variety of social, economic, and cultural factors. Gender norms, cultural barriers, and lack of education leave women even further behind than men. The climate crisis has exacerbated existing gender inequalities and put women's lives and livelihoods at risk.  To shed more light on this growing challenge, allAfrica's Melody Chironda spoke to Jennifer Uchendu, founder of Susty Vibes, a youth-led environmental NGO with the mission to make sustainability actionable for young people in Nigeria. She talks about the importance of climate activism, and gender inequality as well as encouraging young people to become active on climate and sustainable development challenges.
