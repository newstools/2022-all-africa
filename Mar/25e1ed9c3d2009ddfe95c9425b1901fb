The Competition Commission has referred Meta (the new name for the Facebook company) to a tribunal over alleged abuse of its dominance in the social media industry, TechCrunch reports. The commission, which had been investigating claims of unfair conduct against the multi-billion dollar firm since March 2021, recommended that Meta pay a fine of 10% of the U.S. company's local turnover. The Facebook and WhatsApp owner allegedly threatened to block GovChat and its subsidiary #LetsTalk from using its WhatsApp Business Application Programming Interface (API). GovChat is a startup that was launched in 2018 by the South African government and used the WhatsApp Business API to facilitate real time communication between government and citizens. According to government data, it had over 8.7 million active users. According to Reuters, WhatsApp defended its exclusion of GovChat from its API over its alleged failure to comply with Meta's terms of service. A statement from a WhatsApp spokesperson read: "GovChat has repeatedly refused to comply with our policies which are designed to protect citizens and their information, preferring to prioritise their own commercial interests over the public. We will continue to defend WhatsApp from abuse."
