The U.S. Treasury Department has announced financial sanctions against four men in South Africa it accused of being recruiters and fundraisers for the Islamic State group (ISIS). Three of the men allegedly raised money for the extremist group in Iraq and Syria, the Treasury Department said, accusing the fourth of helping move money and buy weapons for insurgents in Mozambique. It added that ISIS was attempting to expand its influence in Africa through large-scale operations in areas where government control is limited, relying on local fundraising schemes such as theft, extortion, kidnapping or ransom alongside support from the ISIS hierarchy.  South African soldiers, together with others in the Southern African Development Community (SADC), are involved in the battle to clear up the bloody insurgency in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique.
