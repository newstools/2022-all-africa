Tanzanian prosecutors have dropped terrorism charges against Chadema party opposition leader Freeman Mbowe and three others, who were released on March 4, 2022 after being held for eight months. Police arrested the four in 2021, in the port city of Mwanza where Mbowe was to address a meeting to discuss constitutional reforms. Rights activists welcomed Mbowe's release but said more needs to be done to address human rights issues in the country, such as laws that allow suspects to be jailed before investigations into their alleged crimes are completed.
