The Special Investigation Unit (SIU) has presented what Raymond Joseph of GroundUp described as a "litany of fraud, money laundering and networks of corruption" involving a senior member of the National Lotteries Commission (NLC), his family and two former board members, and hijacked non-profits and shelf companies to Parliament. The SIU was reporting to Parliament's Trade and Industry Portfolio Committee on its investigation which began in November 2020, after President Cyril Ramaphosa signed a proclamation empowering it to probe alleged corruption involving the NLC. "The SIU investigation has uncovered a web of corruption related to NLC funding and flow of funds to NLC officials, board members, and their family members. The SIU is pursuing all individuals involved in the syphoning of NLC money," the SIU tweeted during the presentation.
