The hope of an African film winning the Best International Feature Film award, has once again been dashed as all films submitted from the continent have been excluded. In the run-up for the Oscars, ten African countries submitted their nominations for the Best International Film category formerly known as Best Foreign Language Film. The 10 films are Djaâfar Gacem's 'Heliopolis' (Algeria), Ngang Romanus' 'Hidden Dreams' (Cameroon), Mahamat-Saleh Haroun's 'Lingui, The Sacred Bonds' (Chad), Ayten Amin's 'Souad' (Egypt), Gilbert Lukalia's 'Mission to Rescue' (Kenya). Others include Gift Sukez Sukali's 'Fatsani: A Tale of Survival' (Malawi), Nabil Ayouch's 'Casablanca Beats' (Morocco), Khadar Ayderus Ahmed's 'The Gravedigger's Wife' (Somalia), Amy Jephta's 'Barakat' (South Africa), and Abdelhamid Bouchnak's 'Golden Butterfly' (Tunisia). The last win for Africa was in 2006, when a South African production, Tsotsi, won the Oscar for best foreign-language film. Nigeria's internationally renowned Nollywood industry produces around 2,500 films a year and it hasn't won a single foreign film Academy Award. The 94th Academy Awards will take place on March 27, 2022 in Hollywood.
