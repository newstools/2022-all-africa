A Briter Bridges report reveals African startup investment trends, as interest in startups across the continent continues to grow, particularly in the financial technology (fintech) space. However, gender disparities remain as the report found that funding to African startups are mostly secured by all-male teams. Additionally, and for both all-male and all-female teams, the largest investments are allocated to companies registered or incorporated outside Africa.           allAfrica's Andre van Wyk took a closer look at the business of startups, funding, how it works on the continent and chatted with Hannah Subayi Kamuanga who attended the 9th Sankalp Africa Summit held in Nairobi, Kenya in March 2022.
