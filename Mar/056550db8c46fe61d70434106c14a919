Marry Mubaiwa, the estranged wife of Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, has been barred from leaving the country to seek treatment in South Africa for lymphoedema, a condition that has left her lower limbs swollen and infested with boil-like wounds. Doctors in Zimbabwe are recommending an urgent amputation of her right forearm, warning that her current condition is life-threatening, due to the onset of sepsis. Mubaiwa reportedly fell and suffered multiple fractures to her arm. Mubaiwa was due to appear in a Harare court, to determine whether she breached the Marriages Act, in which she allegedly misrepresented that her husband Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, consented to solemnise their marriage under the Act, during the time he was hospitalised in South Africa in 2019. Mubaiwa is also facing charges of attempted murder of the vice president at the time of his hospitalisation, as well as charges of fraud and money laundering, writes Nyore Madzianike for The Herald.
