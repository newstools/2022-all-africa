In the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, global prevalence of anxiety and depression increased by a massive 25%, according to a scientific brief released by the World Health Organization (WHO). The brief also highlights who has been most affected and summarises the effect of the pandemic on the availability of mental health services and how this has changed during the pandemic. Concerns about potential increases in mental health conditions had already prompted 90% of countries surveyed to include mental health and psychosocial support in their Covid-19 response plans, but major gaps and concerns remain. "The information we have now about the impact of Covid-19 on the world's mental health is just the tip of the iceberg," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. "This is a wake-up call to all countries to pay more attention to mental health and do a better job of supporting their populations' mental health." As of March 3, 2022, confirmed cases of Covid-19 from 55 African countries reached 11,246,735 while over 247,230,238 vaccinations have been administered across the continent.
