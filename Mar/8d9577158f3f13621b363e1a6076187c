While International Women's Day is celebrated around the world today March 8, challenges for women across the globe, remain. From wars and conflict to sexual exploitation, human trafficking and lack of access to political office, or having their voices silenced through legislation, to the horror of female genital mutilation - these are but some of the atrocities experienced by women in Africa and the world. Despite all these challenges and hardship, women remain resilient. Women are the rock on which nations are built. The fight for women's rights and for women's voices to be heard, continues.
