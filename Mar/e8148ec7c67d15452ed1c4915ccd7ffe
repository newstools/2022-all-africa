Rwanda is fully opening land borders, two years after they were closed to ordinary traffic as one of the measures to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Through the country's land borders, the only people allowed to cross were trucks transporting merchandise and emergency travellers that included Rwandan citizens returning from neighbouring countries. Petite Barriere in Rubavu District, which links Rwanda to the DR Congo, was among the border points affected. Prior to the pandemic, over 50,000 people used to cross the border daily, making it one of the busiest land borders in the world. Petite Barriere has for decades been a source of income to thousands of people in both Goma and Gisenyi communities with most eking a living from informal trade. Since the closure, life changed for the worse for many in Rubavu and across in Goma town, writes Germain Nsanzimana for The New Times.
