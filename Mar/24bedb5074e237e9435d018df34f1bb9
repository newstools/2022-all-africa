Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi has cautioned non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operating in the country against engaging in what he has termed partisan politics ahead of the August 9 polls. Matiangi stated that the government does not want to interfere with the operations of the NGO sector but they should thread carefully for the sake of the country's future. He added that they must do whatever they can to ensure the electoral process is not a conduit through which "the worst of our passion are expressed and the worst of our partisan interest are expressed to the detriment of the unity and stability of our country." Kenya has already experienced a few instances of political violence and intolerance in some parts of the country which rights organizations, and a section of leaders and citizens have warned could escalate if urgent interventions are not put in place. The government has also given some 7, 213 NGOs operating in the country that are yet to file their annual returns with the NGO Coordination Board 90 days to be compliant or risk deregistration. NGOs working on a range of issues, particularly accountability, security forces abuses, and elections, continue to face hostile rhetoric and restrictions, including threats of closure by authorities.
