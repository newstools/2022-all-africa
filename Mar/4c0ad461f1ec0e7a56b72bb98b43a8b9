Burkina Faso-born architect Diebedo Francis Kere has become the first African to win the Pritzker Prize, architecture's most prestigious honour, in its more than 40-year history. Kere achieved the feat with a portfolio consisting largely of schools, health centres, and community facilities - projects that might once have been considered too modest for a prize that has historically honoured the designers of iconic buildings.  In an interview with AFP, Kere said he was the "happiest man on this planet" to become the 51st recipient of the illustrious prize since it was first awarded in 1979. "I have a feeling of an overwhelming honour but also a sense of responsibility," he added. Kere is renowned for building schools, health facilities, housing, civic buildings, and public spaces across Africa, including Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Togo, Kenya, Mozambique and Sudan. He will officially be named Pritzker laureate at a ceremony in London later this year. As with previous winners, he will be awarded a U.S.$100,000 grant and a bronze medal.
