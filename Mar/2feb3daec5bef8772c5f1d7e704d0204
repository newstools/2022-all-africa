Tapera Sengweni, legal advisor of the Douglas Mwonzora-led opposition MDC-T has filed a constitutional court application to stop the March 26 by-elections arguing President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) failed to proclaim the polls within the stipulated time. The constitution says by-elections should take place not more than 90 days after the vacancies arise. In the application Sengweni also says Zimbabwe is facing an economic crisis and elections are not necessary. Zimbabwe will hold by-elections to fill vacancies in local authorities and the National Assembly - most of which fell vacant because of internal opposition politics, although in some cases, the passing away of some candidates. At least 16 political parties are contesting in the 28 by-elections.
