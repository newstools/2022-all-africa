The Libyan parliament granted its confidence to the government of Prime Minister Fathi Bachagha, appointed two weeks ago to replace the cabinet of Abdel Hamid Dbeibah, whose mandate theoretically ended on December 24, 2021.           The 38-member government presented by Bachagha to the deputies, consists of 29 ministers, 6 ministers of state and three deputy prime ministers, including two women.           The new government was formed while taking into consideration the balance between the three regions that form Libya, and to satisfy the sensitivities of each zone, particularly with regard to sovereign portfolios, which is represented by three deputy prime ministers from the  south, east and west of Libya.
