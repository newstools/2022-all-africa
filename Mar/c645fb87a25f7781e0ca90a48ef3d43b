The Zimbabwe Republic Police has released 11 of the 16 suspects nabbed for politically motivated violence which erupted during the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) leader Nelson Chamisa's rally in Kwekwe on February 27, 2022. At least one opposition activist was killed and 17 others were injured after violence broke out during the rally. On February 26, 2022 police had already violently dispersed hundreds of opposition supporters in Gokwe, claiming they were understaffed to properly monitor the rally. "This assault bears all the hallmarks of a pre-meditated attack that aims to intimidate political opposition and block access to their constituents ahead of the upcoming by-elections in March. The government's rhetoric has done much to incite such ferocious violence and unfortunately little to ensure the free exercise of the rights to freedom of assembly and association," said Muleya Mwananyanda, Amnesty International's Deputy Director  for Southern Africa. President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who succeeded late former president Robert Mugabe in 2017 and ruled with an iron fist for 37 years, is regularly accused of wanting to muzzle any dissenting opinion.
