Since seizing power in September 2021, Guinea's military junta has increasingly attempted to streamline mining activities and agreements to benefit what leaders have repeatedly dubbed as 'Guinea's interests'.           Guinea is the world's second-largest producer of bauxite, a main source of aluminum. According to the World Bank, Guinea's mining sector contributes approximately 35% to the country's GDP. But the recent upheavals in the sector could threaten the future of the industry.           Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto and its partners, have been ordered to stop all work on the vast Simandou iron ore project after junta leader and Interim President, Mamady Doumbouya requested that mines clarify how the sector will preserve Guinea's national interests.           The provisional government said that any developer of the mine must also build a railway from Simandou, in the southeast of the country, to the port of Conakry to ship their product overseas. If they do not comply, developers will risk losing the project.           With the future of the Simandou project in doubt, economist Mamady Fanta Keita, warned of potentially devastating consequences for Guineans.
