Al-Shabaab mounted one of its deadliest attacks last week, targeting elections at the regional presidential palace in Beledweyne town. Forty-eight people were killed and more than 100 others were wounded.           Among the dead was firebrand woman member of parliament, Amina Mohamed, who was on the campaign trail when she was targeted and killed by a suicide bomber.           Hours earlier, two Al Shabaab militants breached the heavily guarded compound at Mogadishu's airport, where presidential elections are scheduled to take place.           Somalia has been in election mode since July 2021, to fill the 329 seats in its parliament.      However, that process has been marred by delays caused by political wrangling, both at the local level and between the president Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo and prime minister Mohamed Hussein Roble  .
