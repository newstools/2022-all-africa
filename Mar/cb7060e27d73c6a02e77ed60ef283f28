The U.S., UK and Norway - known as the Troika - have condemned the South Sudan People's Defense Force (SSPDF) for attacking SPLA-In Opposition military bases in parts of the Upper Nile region.           On Tuesday, the SPLM/A-IO (South Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army-In Opposition), a principal signatory to the peace deal, declared it had pulled out from security mechanism talks as well as the Revitalized Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (R-JMEC).           The decision follows repeated military attacks by SSPDF forces on the group's military bases in parts of Upper Nile state and "inconsistencies" in attending mechanism meetings and implementing resolutions, according to Colonel Lam Paul Gabriel, the SPLA-IO spokesperson.           According to Tom Carter, a British Embassy spokesperson in Juba, the Troika said it "regrets the decision by the SPLM/A-IO to withdraw its participation from the security mechanisms and urged all parties to recommit to the peace deal".
