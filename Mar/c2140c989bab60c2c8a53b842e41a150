The National Drug Authority has ordered all private pharmacies located in premises of government facilities to leave immediately. The development comes a few days after the Mulago Hospital Executive Director Byarugaba Baterana was arrested. The allegations against the director include the disappearance of U.S.$7 million from hospital coffers, and the irregular recruitment of two firms that forged documents to enable them to win tenders, to provide services at the hospital, the State House Health Monitoring Unit has said. Doctors under the umbrella of the Uganda Medical Association, have asked the Health Monitoring Unit not to only focus their investigation on Mulago Hospital, but also other health departments in the country.
