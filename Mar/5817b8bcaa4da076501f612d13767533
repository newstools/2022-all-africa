A new opinion poll has predicted the likelihood of a female president in ten years, with 48% of respondents interviewed supporting the proposition. The poll conducted by Trends for Insights Africa (TIFA) on the status of women in politics, identified political parties, culture, family and community among factors derailing women's participation in politics. In the research, women interviewed responded with 53%, to the question on the likelihood of a woman president, while 42% of male respondents held that the country might see a woman president in office in ten years. The study comes amid little interest shown by women to run for the highest office. The TIFA poll also indicated a high likelihood of having a woman in the deputy president post in the next ten years, reports Irene Mwangi for Capital FM.
