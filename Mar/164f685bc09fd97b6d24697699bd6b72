Protests were held in towns and cities across Sudan at the weekend to call for the end to the military junta and a return to civilian government. Protesters also deplored the soaring prices for bread and basic commodities, as the economy falters in the run-up to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.           The El Gezira radio and television reported soaring prices of transportation, as well as basic consumer goods, especially sugar, oil, sorghum and millet, wheat, and meat, as the month of Ramadan is nearing, and people have begun to prepare for the fast.           Meanwhile, the dollar exchange rate recorded a new record in banks and the parallel market on Sunday, and the price of the dollar in the Bank of Khartoum reached SDG605, an increase of five Pounds on Thursday.           Military rulers this week announced an emergency committee to address the country's collapsing economy and pointed to its gold mining as a possible boost. Sudan's ambassador to Russia has denied reports that Moscow has been smuggling gold from Sudan in preparation for sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. But Sudanese analysts say gold smuggling is rampant, including to Russia.
