t's all systems go for African teams Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Algeria and Egypt, as they prepare for the FIFA World Cup soccer showcase in Qatar, which will take place from November 21, 2022 to December 18, 2022.              Ghana's senior national men football team, Black Stars, will depart Accra for Kumasi on March 22, 2022, to begin preparations for the crucial play-off first leg tie against Nigeria's Super Eagles. Former captain and coach of the Nigerian national team, Christian Chukwu, has revealed that Ghana is no longer a threat for Nigeria.      The 70-year-old legend charged the Eagles to throw overboard history - in favour of Ghana to always beat Nigeria - given the edge held by the Black Stars from past encounters.           Cameroon on the other hand have been dealt a blow as midfielder Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa had suffered an injury at his Italian club Napoli and will be unavailable for their decisive 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Algeria.           Cameroon will be in the hunt for their eighth world cup participation, against an Algerian side that is in search of their fifth appearance at the global event, with the hopes of doing better than their round of 16 finish in Brazil in 2014.           Mohamed Salah on the other hand will be fit for Egypt's game against Senegal in FIFA World Cup qualifiers. The Egyptian winger suffered a foot injury during the Reds' 2-0 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion in the English Premier League.
