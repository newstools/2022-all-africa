A train conveying at least 970 passengers from Abuja to Kaduna has been attacked by gunmen suspected to be bandits, in Kaduna State.   It was learnt that the train derailed after an improvised explosive device detonated. Troops were mobilised to the scene of the attack to rescue passengers. This incident comes 48-hours after gunmen attacked the Kaduna International Airport. Following increased attacks and kidnappings on the main road between Abuja and Kaduna, many travellers were preferring to travel by train. This is the second time the railway has been attacked in the last six months. In October 2021, bandits destroyed a portion of the rail track with explosives. The latest violence has been attributed to armed criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, who are blamed for rising violence and mass kidnappings in northwest Nigeria.
