Nigerian secessionist leader Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, a campaigner for Yoruba self-determination, has been released from a Beninese prison on health grounds. According to Igboho's lawyer Yomi Alliyu, Igboho's release was under the agreement that he should not leave the medical centre or Cotonou for any reason. He was arrested on July 20, 2021, at Cotonou Airport in Benin Republic after he stepped off a plane to board another to Germany, where he is a citizen. He was accused of entering Benin illegally and planning to cause trouble but he denied the charges. The Nigerian authorities never made a formal extradition request. He had been declared wanted by Nigerian authorities and his arrest follows a promise made by President Muhammadu Buhari to "fish out troublemakers".
