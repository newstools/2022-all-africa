France and allied European countries are withdrawing their anti-militia forces from Mali after diplomatic relations broke down with the ruling junta, which has reportedly welcomed in hundreds of mercenaries from the Russian, Wagner Group.           Conflict is especially severe in northern Mali, where militants have killed dozens of civilians in recent weeks, while former separatists have grown increasingly impatient with the junta, which they accuse of failing to implement a 2015 peace agreement.           Violence is also spiking in central Mali - which The New Humanitarian visited in February 2022 - where militants have stepped up their use of sieges and other forms of collective punishment against communities ostensibly resisting their rule.           Aid groups have requested nearly U.S.$700 million to meet the growing needs but expect to receive a much smaller amount. Most other humanitarian missions are facing the same challenge, which could worsen as donors devote resources to Ukraine.
