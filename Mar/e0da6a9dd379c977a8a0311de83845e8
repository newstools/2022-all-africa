UN scientists have delivered a stark warning about the impact of climate change on people and the planet, saying that ecosystem collapse, species extinction, deadly heatwaves and floods are among the "unavoidable multiple climate hazards" the world will face over the next two decades due to global warming. According to the report, human-induced climate change is causing dangerous and widespread disruption in nature and affecting billions of lives all over the world, despite efforts to reduce the risks, with people and ecosystems least able to cope.  The report found that the world is likely to reach 1.5C of warming within the next 20 years, even in the best-case scenario of deep emissions cuts and the effects will be more severe than previous estimates. At current levels, climate change caused by human action has already led to widespread, dangerous and possibly irreversible damage including water shortages, extreme heat, melting ice caps and glaciers, wildfires and flooding, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns.
