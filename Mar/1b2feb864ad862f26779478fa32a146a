Deputy President William Ruto has singled out blackmail, threats and intimidation as some of the biggest impediments to democratic elections, as Kenya braces for the August 9, 2022 general elections. Ruto, speaking in Maryland in the U.S., said that Kenyans want to make the choice of their preferred leaders without being intimidated by anyone, including the state machinery, which has been in the spotlight recently for targeting some politicians ahead of the polls. Ruto said that the August 9, 2022 polls will give Kenyans an opportunity to make important decisions about the country's economy and its democratisation. He said that there is a feeling that the economy has been "captured and curtailed and that it has become exclusionist." He added that his administration will be pushing for an all-inclusive economy once he is elected into office. Ruto is on a 10-day U.S.-UK tour which will include conversations on foreign policy, the future of governance, and economic development in Kenya, East Africa, and the African continent.
