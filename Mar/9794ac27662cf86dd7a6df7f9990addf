Three years ago, Judith Mumbua noticed that using commercial fertilisers was creating problems for both her crops and the dirt on her farm in Mwania village, eastern Kenya. Now, she has switched to organic farming, which, she says, has created a more positive outcome and a healthier way to grow crops. It is even better for her livestock, she says. Mumbua started organic farming after a training programme at a local agriculture organisation. She admitted this farming method has helped her curb the antimicrobial crop resistance her plants had experienced for a number of years. Organic agriculture or ecologically-based farming is basically the use of green manure, compost, biological agriculture and biological fertilisers derived from animal waste. According to Mumbua, the method has increased her food quality and production. Mumbua advises farmers to try to make organic medicines for crops using locally available materials such as leaves, chicken droppings, cow dung, goat and sheep droppings and even wood ash from the kitchen. One long-time organic believer is small-scale farmer Peter Melonye, who lives in neigbouring Kajiado County. He has been feeding his livestock organic feed for the past 18 years. Melonye says his livestock produce quality milk, chemical-free and with no antimicrobial resistance strains. When a cow is injected with antibiotics and is milked the following morning, the milk is not safe for consumption, says Dr Dennis Bahati, a veternarian at the Africa Network for Animal Welfare. People consume a lot of antibiotic residues unknowingly, not only in milk but also in meat sold at local butchers without expert approval, reports Victor Moturi for Radio France Internationale.
