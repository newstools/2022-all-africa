Nigeria's House of Representatives may have buckled under pressure from women across the country, rescinding its resolution on three gender bills it earlier threw out at a constitutional amendment session. Women are arguing that the bills would give them leverage, in the political development of the country. The decision announced by the House of Representatives, is an about-turn on parliament's March 1, 2022 decision. It will now reconsider its decision in a month, when it reconvenes for another parliamentary session.  The National Assembly voted against a bill providing for affirmative action for women in political parties' administration. The lawmakers also voted against the bill to create special seats for women in the national and state assemblies. The decision as it currently stands, means that women are denied 35% appointed positions, 35% affirmative action in party administration and leadership.
