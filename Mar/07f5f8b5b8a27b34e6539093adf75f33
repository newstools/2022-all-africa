The build up on social media has been immense and the banter has been huge with Nigeria and Ghana clashing in the first leg of the 2022 FIFA World Cup play-off in Kumasi in Ghana today, March 25, 2022.           Videos of Nigeria disembarking at Ghana airport, using a steep steel ladder, has been the mother of all jokes, as the two countries prepare to jostle for a place at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar in November 21, 2022 to December 18, 2022.           Nigeria's Super Eagles are the favourites heading into tonight's fixture, with the Ghana's Black Star side unconvincing over the past few years, especially with their performance at the Africa Cup of Nations. Heading into the fixture, Super Eagles will look to the in-form Victor Osimhen to inspire them, coming hot into the game from his Italian club Napoli. Osimhen missed the AFCON due to injury, but his return is a boost to the Super Eagles.           Nigeria will also have Watford's Emmanuel Dennis and experienced Odion Ighalo, also both who missed the Africa Cup of Nations will be available and this will offer more attacking options for coach Augustine Eguavoen.             Ghana will be without star striker Andre Ayew who is suspended following his red card at the AFCON and in his place, Arsenal's on-form midfield general Thomas Partey has been tasked with captaining the side.           The Black Star team have handed debut call ups to AS Roma youngster Felix Afena Gyan and former Fulham defender, 33-year old Denis Odoi who now plays in Belgium.
