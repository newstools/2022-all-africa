Germany's federal prosecutors say they have filed charges against a former member of the Gambian army, including allegations of participation in crimes against humanity, murder and attempted murder.           The man, who was arrested in the north-central German city of Hannover in March last year, is believed to have been involved in the killings of a government-critical journalist and a suspected rival of the president. Activists allege he was a member of the "Junglers," a notorious pro-Jammeh death squad.           The alleged crimes were committed from 2003 to 2006 by units deployed by former President Yahya Jammeh to intimidate the population and repress opposition to his rule, they said. Jammeh took power in a bloodless coup in 1994, ruling the country as the head of a military junta before his election as president in 1996.
