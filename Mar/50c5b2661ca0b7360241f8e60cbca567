About 50 human rights organisations have written to South African Minister of Home Affairs Aaron Motsoaledi expressing concerns over the humanitarian impact by choosing to not renew a permit used to regularise Zimbabweans living in the country, Tariro Washinyira of GroundUp reports. Nearly 180,000 Zimbabwean Exemption Permit (ZEP) holders living in South Africa face deportation at the end of 2022 if they are unable to find an alternative permission-of-stay. Most ZEP holders are unlikely to qualify for the critical skills list published on 2 February 2022 by the Minister of Home Affairs. They say the grace period cabinet announced in November 2021 is too short for them to uproot their lives. The ZEP was introduced in 2017, replacing a series of predecessor permits that had regularised Zimbabweans living in South Africa since 2010.
