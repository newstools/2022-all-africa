French international humanitarian medical non-governmental organisation, Doctors without Borders (MSF) announced on March 21, 2022 that it would stop its humanitarian aid operations in two villages in the north eastern Ituri province in DR Congo, due to an increase in violent attacks, two of which recently targeted its workers.           MSF called on armed groups to respect the international law protecting humanitarian aid workers. It also asked the government to carry out an investigation into the attacks but this request has not been responded to. An estimated 122 armed groups of varying sizes operate in mineral-rich eastern DR Congo, many of which are a legacy of regional wars in the 1990s. The army has conducted operations in the area but has not been able to put a stop to the massacre of civilians.
