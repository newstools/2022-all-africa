Nigerians, Ghanaians, Somalis, Moroccans, and other African nationals studying and working in Ukraine, have been trying to escape across the Ukraine border to neighbouring countries, along with thousands of people trapped in the ongoing crisis between Russia and Ukraine. Nigeria will start repatriation flights to countries bordering Ukraine, for its citizens who are willing to return home, according to foreign minister Geoffrey Onyeama. Onyeama said about 5,600 Nigerians are still in Ukraine, most of them students. Efforts are underway to ensure they move to safety in neighbouring Romania, Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary. Ghanaian students will be received by officials from the countries' diplomatic missions, honorary consuls, and officials of the Ghana students' associations. They are expected to return to Ghana in the coming days. More than 1,000 Ghanaian nationals are currently studying or working in Ukraine. DR Congo Foreign Minister Christophe Lutundula said on Twitter he will be meeting with the Polish ambassador to help with the passage across the border of about 200 Congolese, mostly students. Many Africans had complained of discrimination at border crossings after being prevented from boarding trains and busses that were carrying foreigners fleeing the conflict.
