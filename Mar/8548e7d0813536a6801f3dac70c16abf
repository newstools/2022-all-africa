A joint statement signed on March 8, 2022 by ambassadors and heads of mission to Sudan, from countries that include Canada, Norway, Spain, France, Japan, Sweden, Germany, Ireland, UK, South Korea, U.S., Netherlands and the EU, has stated that the October 25, 2021 military coup has stalled - and in some cases reversed - the progress made after the December 2018 uprising that culminated in the overthrow of the 30-year Omar Al Bashir dictatorship in April 2019.           The diplomats expressed their "steadfast support of the Sudanese people" to achieve the rights to freedom of expression and media freedoms.  In her update on Sudan to the Human Rights Council's 49th session, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, raised concerns over attacks against journalists - which poses a severe threat to freedom of expression.  Protesters have met with lethal force and activists have been arrested. Local and foreign journalists have been detained and threatened, and media outlets have been raided. "We have also witnessed an increase in hate speech. The overall effect has been to shrink civic space, increase self-censorship and weaken media independence and pluralism", the diplomats said.
