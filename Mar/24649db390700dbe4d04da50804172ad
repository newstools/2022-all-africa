The International Criminal Court's trial of Ali Kosheib, also known as Kushayb, will open on April 5, 2022, and offers the first opportunity to see a leader face prosecution for massive crimes committed in Darfur nearly 20 years ago.           "Kosheib's trial is a long-awaited chance for victims and communities terrorised by the notorious Janjaweed militia and government forces in Darfur to see a leader held to account. In the face of steep odds and no other credible options, the ICC is serving as the crucial court of last resort for Darfuris", said Elise Keppler, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch.           An arrest warrant was issued by the ICC for the paramilitary leader in 2007. He faces 31 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed in 2003 and 2004. He surrendered in 2020 and was brought to The Hague, which confirmed his indictment the following year.           Kushayb has denied the charges and unsuccessfully challenged the court's jurisdiction.           "Would-be abusers should take note that they can end up in court even if it is slow going. Now, Sudanese authorities should surrender the remaining fugitives, including former president Omar al-Bashir, so victims have the opportunity to also see them held to account." Keppler said.
