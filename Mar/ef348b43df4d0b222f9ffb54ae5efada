The National Assembly has voted against a bill providing for affirmative action for women in political parties' administration. The lawmakers also voted against the bill to create special seats for women in the national and state assemblies. The decision by the lawmakers means women are denied 35% appointed positions, 35% affirmative action in party administration and leadership.  This bill would have come down to creating 111 extra seats for women at the National Assembly. Meanwhile, a coalition of 229 women groups has condemned the National Assembly for rejecting all gender bills during the voting on the amendments to the 1999 Constitution. The groups, in a statement, described as sad the lawmakers' decision to deny women the opportunity of inclusion and representation in governance by voting against the gender bills. The civil society groups and other concerned Nigerians vowed to name and shame the lawmakers for voting against the bill, aimed at promoting gender equality in Nigeria.
