Deputy President William Ruto has been kicked out as Jubilee Party's deputy leader.  The decision was ratified during the party's National Delegates Convention (NDC) that split the post into four. The new officials taking over the post include; Jimmy Angwenyi who will serve as Deputy party leader (Strategy), Kinoti Gatobu (Operations), Naomi Shaban (Outreach), Peter Mositet (Programmes). DP Ruto decamped to United Democratic Alliance, after a fallout with President Uhuru Kenyatta that intensified after the president's public handshake deal with opposition chief Raila Odinga.  Ruto has since said that the president did not consult him before entering into a deal with Odinga who ran against them in the last general election. Kenyatta has vowed to support Odinga to succeed him in the August 2023 elections, describing his deputy as "a rebel who is dangerous for the country". Ruto is currently in Washington, DC  - part of a ten-day tour of the U.S. and the UK - where he is expected to hold a series of meetings and also meet Kenyans living in the Diaspora. He will be discussing foreign policy, democracy and governance. He will also expound on his economic vision for Kenya and Africa with government officials from both countries, reports Capital FM.
