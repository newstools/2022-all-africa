The International Criminal Court (ICC) has said that Chadian authorities have handed over a former Central African Republic militia leader to the court for trial.           Maxime Jeoffroy Eli Mokom Gawaka is suspected of war crimes and crimes against humanity, allegedly committed between 2013 and 2014. The ICC said that it has "reasonable grounds" to believe that Mokom was an anti-Balaka leader, and issued a warrant for his arrest in 2018.           Since late 2012, a civil war has been raging in the Central African Republic between Muslim-majority militias in the "Seleka" coalition and predominantly Christian and animist "anti-Balaka" militias, loyal to former President Francois Bozize.           The U.S., previously through its embassy in CAR, published a warrant offering up to U.S.$5 million for information leading to the capture of another warlord Joseph Kony.
