Cabinet has noted what it called the "remarkable progress" achieved by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) in their intensive investigation of maladministration and corruption within the National Lotteries Commission (NLC).           "This will ensure the necessary steps can be taken to hold accountable persons or or"anisations implicated in the unlawful misappropriation of funds earmarked to benefit the poor," said Minister in the Presidency Mondli Gungubele who briefed media in Pretoria.           In an earlier development, the SIU reported to Parliament's Trade and Industry Portfolio Committee on its investigation which began in November 2020, after President Cyril Ramaphosa signed a proclamation empowering it to probe alleged corruption involving the NLC.           "The SIU investigation has uncovered a web of corruption related to NLC funding and flow of funds to NLC officials, board members, and their family members. The SIU is pursuing all individuals involved in the syphoning of NLC money," the SIU tweeted during a presentation.
