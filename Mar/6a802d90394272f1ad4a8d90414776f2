Parliamentarians in Zimbabwe have fumed after it turned out that the Dubai Expo drained state coffers millions of dollars in foreign currency recently after parastatals' top management attended the event. During deliberations in the House of Assembly, it was revealed that most of the senior executives in the state-owned enterprises, who appeared before the Lands and Agriculture parliamentary portfolio committee, were not informed of what was expected from them at the Dubai Expo visit, which was fully government-funded. It was also reported that some officials who attended, allegedly bought lavish cars through allowances. The committee is yet to ascertain how much was used. Critics are accusing the Zanu-PF government of wasting Zimbabwe's resource potential through corruption, bad legislation and incompetence.
