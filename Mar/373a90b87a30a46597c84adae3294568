A group of Nigerian widows have lost their case after suing the oil giant Shell for its alleged role in the unlawful arrest, detention, and execution of their husbands for opposing the oil giant and the military government. On November 10, 1995, nine Nigerian environmental activists accused of murder, were executed by former military ruler Sani Abacha. Their deaths sparked an international outcry that lingers to this day. The men executed, were a group that became known as the "Ogoni Nine" - activists that included writer Ken Saro-Wiwa.  The Dutch court ruled that there was not enough evidence to support the widows' claim that Shell had been involved in bribing witnesses related to the case. Shell has always denied any wrongdoing.
