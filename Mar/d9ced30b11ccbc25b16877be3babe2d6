Capital FM reports that millions of dollars of public funds allegedly stolen by two of Kenya's richest men Samuel Gichuru and former Finance Minister Chris Okemo - are being returned to the country to buy life-saving Covid-19 equipment following a landmark agreement signed in London. The deal with Jersey, a self-governing island in the English Channel, was hailed as "a victory for the people of Kenya" by its High Commissioner in the UK, Manoah Esipisu. The entangled web of connections that eventually ended in this deal first emerged following a divorce case. Back in 2006, Gichuru, the wealthy boss of Kenya's power company, and his wife Salome Njeri were divorced. When it came to splitting up their assets, Njeri felt she was not getting her fair share. She alleged some of her husband's assets were being hidden from the proceedings and, in court, listed details of accounts she said belonged to Gichuru in Jersey, which is often associated with secretive offshore banking and a low-tax environment. That sparked a nine-year investigation by the Jersey authorities across 12 jurisdictions. As part of that investigation, in 2011, Gichuru and Okemo were accused of taking kickbacks from multinationals which were sent to a Jersey-registered company. With the funds now on their way from Jersey to Kenya, the focus turns to the possible extradition from Kenya to Jersey of the two accused men. At the beginning of February 2022, extradition proceedings finally got under way in Nairobi's City Magistrates' Court, after a 10-year legal battle over whether the government's chief legal officer or the public prosecutor should be leading the case.
