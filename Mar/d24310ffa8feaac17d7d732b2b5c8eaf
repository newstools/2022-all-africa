Just under a third of South Africa's remaining Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer are set to expire by July 2022. After that, any unused doses will have to be destroyed. Until then the health department is trying to increase uptake of the doses and donate spare shots, write Mia Malan and Laura Grant for Daily Maverick.           South Africa has received all the 30 million Pfizer Covid jabs it has procured from the drug manufacturer and the last batch that was delivered - a consignment of 4,831,560 shots that arrived between October and December 2021 - expires at the end of July, health department data shows.           After that date, Pfizer jabs not used or redistributed to other countries will have to be destroyed and more doses are unlikely to be procured directly from the company.           As of March 10, 2022, a total of 3,688,423 Covid-19 cases has been confirmed in the country of which 99,656 and 3,569,538 resulted in recovery. Vaccinations administered to date total 20,558,264.
