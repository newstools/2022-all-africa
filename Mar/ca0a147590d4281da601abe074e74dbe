President Muhammadu Buhari is set to travel to London for a "routine" medical check-up for approximately two weeks, without offiicially placing Vice President Yemi Osinbajo in charge, writes Kabir Yusuf for Premium Times.  Buhari is currently in Kenya to attend the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA) and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the UN Environment Programme. He is expected to leave Kenya and head straight to London, his spokesman Femi Adesina announced. Buhari has been heavily criticised for seeking treatment abroad while Nigeria's health system is failing - largely due to mismanagement and under-funding.  Buhari's latest medical trip is coming as Nigerians contend with hardship brought about by acute scarcity of fuel. Buhari is the substantive minister of petroleum resources, a development which makes him directly responsible for the energy crisis in the oil-producing country. Many Nigerians have been forced to rely on the black market for fuel. The president, who has been in office since 2015, has been receiving treatment for an undisclosed ailment.
