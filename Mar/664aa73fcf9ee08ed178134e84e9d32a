Officials have asked the White House to send several hundred troops to Somalia, the Wall Street Journal reported last week.           In the final weeks of his presidency, President Donald Trump ordered "the majority" of American troops to leave Somalia, sending some members of the U.S. military to neighbouring countries, including Kenya and Djibouti, and continuing their counterterrorism mission from outside the country.           The head of U.S. Africa Command, General Stephen Townsend, told senators that Al-Shabaab, an Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group in eastern Africa, is "among the world's fastest-growing, wealthiest, and deadliest terrorist groups" that poses a threat to Americans, and that a U.S military presence relegated to neighbouring countries is insufficient to combat it.           Lawmakers on March 15, 2022 expressed support for boosting the American troop presence in Somalia. Senator James Inhofe, a ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he opposed the Trump administration's order to withdraw nearly all American troops from Somalia and rely on over-the-horizon capabilities for counterterrorism.
