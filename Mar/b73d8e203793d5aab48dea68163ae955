The final volume of the report on the three-year-long Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture has made multiple findings on government entities and individuals including how Bosasa targeted the Department of Correctional Services and public entities, enabling it to benefit from unlawful state contracts. The government service provider was also assisted by the Jacob Zuma Foundation's Dudu Myeni who halted a corruption probe after receiving a Louis Vuitton bag stuffed with a U.S.$20,785 bribe. The first volume of the report sent shockwaves from an 87-page examination of how former president Jacob Zuma and his accomplices captured the South African Revenue Service. The report recommended prosecution against former high-ranking lawmakers and their public and private sector affiliates. It also called for greater protection of whistleblowers and the establishment of a single, multifunctional, properly resourced and independent anti-corruption authority by the government, with a mandate to "confront the abuses inherent in the present system".
