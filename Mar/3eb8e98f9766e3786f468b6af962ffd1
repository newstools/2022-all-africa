Orange Democratic Movement Party leader Raila Odinga has disclosed that President Uhuru Kenyatta will be his "adviser" when he forms the next administration. Odinga said he will seek Kenyatta's advice on the day-to-day running operations of government. The former prime minister revealed that other options for the outgoing head of state would be for him "to do business, or be a foreign diplomat serving in the AU". President Kenyatta on March 12, 2022 endorsed his former arch-rival for the country's top job, weeks after their parties joined forces.  Kenyatta has been accused by his critics of hiding behind Odinga, to rule the country for a third term - claims which Kenyatta has denied. Deputy President William Ruto and his allies believe that Odinga will be a 'puppet president' , with Kenyatta ruling the country through the back door, reports Davis Ayega for Capital FM.
