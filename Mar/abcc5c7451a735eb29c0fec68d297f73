This statement was made by the World Health Organization chief Tedros Ghebreyesus during a briefing where the ongoing conflict in the country's Tigray region was discussed. According to Addis Standard,  Amhara regional state has said 11.6 million people in the region alone are in need of food aid and about 263,000 displaced people are living in the area, according to Gizachew Muluneh, Amhara State Government Communication Affairs Bureau Head. This is putting pressure on the regional economy in Amhara State as the effects of the war were already being felt. Tedros also added that said that six million people in Tigray, where about three-quarters of health facilities assessed by WHO have been damaged or destroyed, "have been under blockade by Ethiopian and Eritrean forces for almost 500 days, sealed off from the outside world". There is nowhere on earth where the health of millions of people is more under threat than in Tigray, the WHO chief said.
