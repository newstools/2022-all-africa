The flooding of Lake Albert, in Africa's Great Lakes Region, has caused huge economic losses on the shores of Uganda, where people are already struggling to recover from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the Buliisa district, situated on the north-eastern edge of Lake Albert, the flooding is said to have resulted in more than U.S.$250,000 worth of economic losses. Traders were hit hard by the cancellation of the ferry from Wanseko to Panyimur, the region's biggest fish market which also suffered the loss of electricity, which was cut off when power lines were submerged. Many of Buliisa's poverty alleviation projects, based along the shores of Lake Albert, were severely disrupted, whilst unemployed young people attempting to earn money in spite of the flooding, faced a further obstacle, in the face of the Ugandan Government's operation to combat illegal fishing on the lake. Those who have remained on the shores of Lake Albert, are striving to get back on their feet, as they adjust and wait for the flood waters of the lake to recede.
