The government has started the extradition process of top policeman Abba Kyari to the United States to face trial for alleged fraud and abuse of office. The U.S. demanded Kyari's extradition in April 2021 for his alleged involvement in the U.S.$1.1 million wire fraud by fraudster Ramon Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi. Kyari is accused of agreeing to detain one of Hushpuppi's co-conspirators after they had fallen out.   The former "super cop" is also facing separate drug charges in Nigeria after being accused by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency of being a member of an international drug cartel. Kyari was lauded as Nigeria's most decorated cop and was deputy commissioner in charge of the police's Intelligence Response Team until his suspension. He was conferred with a presidential medal for courage by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2016.
