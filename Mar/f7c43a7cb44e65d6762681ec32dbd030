The UK has temporarily suspended applications for work, study, and family visas in Nigeria because it is "prioritising applications made under the Ukraine family scheme, in response to the humanitarian crisis arising from the invasion of Ukraine." "We are still currently unable to offer priority visas for visitor applications in Nigeria. Standard visitor applications are currently taking an average of six weeks to process," said the UK government. They further noted that Nigerians whose passports were ready for collection would be contacted by the visa application centre.  Ukraine has come under severe missile and armour attacks since February 24, 2022 when Russian forces invaded the European country. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled the country, leaving NATO-affiliated European nations rushing to take them in as refugees.
