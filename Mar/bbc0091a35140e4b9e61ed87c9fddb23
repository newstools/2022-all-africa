The Ethiopian government has issued a declaration of humanitarian truce in the #Tigray regional state effective today, March 24, 2022. The government has, according to Addis Standard, also called for a significant increase in the support of humanitarian assistance by the international community. The conflict between Ethiopia and Tigray began in November 2020, when the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) went ahead with regional elections in Tigray State, despite a central government decision to postpone polls due to the Covid-19 pandemic. An East African analyst Dr Abdiwahab Abdisamad said at the time that "the Tigrayans are opposed to PM Abiy Ahmed because they are the elites and remnants of (former prime minister) Meles Zenawi. They oppose his policies and are powerful because they took advantage of Meles' years in power to enrich themselves." An attack by Tigrayan militants on an Ethiopian army base followed the regional elections, leading to a conflict that has seen the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians and Tigrayans fleeing their homes to neighbouring countries. There has also been reports from organisations such as Human Rights Watch, of various human rights violations by Ethiopia, Eritrea forces and Tigrayan militants. Reports of the burning of civilians, allegedly by Ethiopian forces, have also been received. Ethiopia has been slammed by organisations like the UN  who urged the government to allow for unhindered aid to people, while the AU  remained unclear, despite seeking support for its peace mission to Ethiopia, which was led by former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo. Ethiopia has also been faced with proposed sanctions, particularly from the U.S..   Peace between Ethiopia and Tigray would be more than welcome by Africa and the rest of the world, particularly in light of the current conflict between Russia and the Ukraine.
