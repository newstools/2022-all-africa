New attacks by armed Arab assailants on civilians in west Darfur since April 2022 have left hundreds dead, thousands displaced, and hundreds of civilian homes scorched, and property looted, Human Rights Watch has said.           The United Nations reported that the latest attack on civilians in the town of Kulbus and neighboring villages, in West Darfur between June 6 and 11, 2022, left at least 125 people dead, including five children, over 100 injured, and 33,000 displaced. Most of the victims are reported to be from the non-Arab Gimir community. The attackers reportedly burned homes and farms and looted livestock.           The large-scale violence has been carried out particularly against civilians in Kerenik and Kulbus. It underscores the Sudanese government's failure to fulfill its duty to protect civilians and the urgent need for ramped up United Nations monitoring, protection through its presence, and public reporting on events in Darfur Human Right Watch says.
