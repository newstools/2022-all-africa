Despite the widespread insecurity and the worsening economic situation across Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari says his administration is leaving Nigeria "in a far better place than we found it", thanks to investments in infrastructure and policies that have bolstered local production. The Nigerian leader said this in an email response to questions by Bloomberg. Under his watch, the government has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars in stolen state funds, built new transport links, and beaten back militant group Boko Haram, Buhari said. He also ruled out the possibility of heeding calls by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and other leading economists to remove fuel subsidies. Buhari said that he was winning the war against corruption, starting with the Whistleblowing Policy enacted in his first year in office, revealing that hundreds of millions in stolen funds have been returned to Nigeria. He stated that the monies had now been deployed as social and welfare funds distributed directly to the poorest during the Covid-19 pandemic and the provision of long-delayed infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, rail, and power. Buhari is due to step down after the February 2023 elections.
