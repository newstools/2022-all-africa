An official has told The New Times that the talks are set to focus on issues around the inter-Congolese dialogue under the 'Nairobi Process' on the peace and security situation in eastern DR Congo.           DR Congo is the newest member of the seven-nation bloc, the others being Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. The previous round of talks, held in April, drew the leaders of Burundi, DR Congo, Uganda and hosts Kenya. Rwanda was then represented by the Minister for Foreign and International Cooperation.           Meanwhile, consultations on the proposed deployment of a regional force in eastern DR Congo were held in Nairobi on Sunday, drawing military chiefs from EAC partner states. It was, however, unclear which countries were represented in the meeting. The Kenyan government had earlier said the meeting of the military chiefs was meant to finalise plans for the deployment.
