Motorists queuing for several hours at petrol pumps in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, has become the new normal after an acute scarcity in fuel earlier this year. In February 2022 the government announced that bad fuel containing a high level of methanol was imported into the country by oil marketers, saying that the contaminated fuel needed to be withdrawn from petrol stations across the country. Coupled with the disruption of petroleum imports into Nigeria due to the Russia-Ukraine war, residents face even more shortfalls and delays. The prolonged shortage of fuel has prompted Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari to apologise to "all sections of the society" for the inconvenience, but he stressed that relief is on the way. Africa's richest man Aliko Dangote has been working on what is billed as the largest single-train refinery in the world, with a projected output of 650,000 barrels per day. Upon completion later this year - or in early 2023 if plans remain on schedule - it will provide a strong domestic option for refining petroleum products for Nigeria's use.
