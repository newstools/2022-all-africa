Nearly half of all pregnancies, totaling 121 million worldwide each year, are unintended.  The State of World Population 2022 report - Seeing the Unseen: The Case for Action in the Neglected Crisis of Unintended Pregnancy - highlights unintended pregnancies as a global failure of basic human rights. It reveals the scope and impact of unplanned pregnancy on women, girls, households, societies, countries, and global development. In Southern Africa, 65% of pregnancies between 2015 and 2019 were unintended, and 36% ended in abortion. The predominant cause of unintended pregnancy is sexual activity without the use of effective contraception, Globally, an estimated 257 million women who want to avoid pregnancy are not using safe, modern methods of contraception, and where data is available, nearly a quarter of all women are not able to say no to sex.
