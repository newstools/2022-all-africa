The David and Goliath battle of climate activists against plans by Shell has resumed in South Africa. The case, which in February 2022 saw the High Court in Makhanda dismiss the oil giant and Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe's application for leave to appeal a ruling that temporarily halted a seismic survey off the Wild Coast in the Eastern Cape province, is significant as its outcome will determine the wellbeing of South Africa's ocean environment and the livelihoods of rural Eastern Cape communities. It also determines where the nation will take its fight against climate change, coming in the wake of deadly floods in KwaZulu-Natal attributed to the current climate crisis and an announcement there are no plans for the nation to discontinue the use of coal as part of the country's energy mix. Between May 30 and June 1 2022, three judges in the High Court in Gqeberha heard arguments about whether to review and set aside a decision by the department of mineral resources and energy to award a seismic exploration right to the petroleum giant. After the hearing, Natural Justice - a non-profit organisation dedicated to the protection indigenous peoples and local communities' rights - held a webinar to reflect on the case and what kind of action would be needed to address possible outcomes.
