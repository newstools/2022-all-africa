The World Health Organisation's member states agree that for peace to prevail in conflict affected places, good medical assistance and health resources should be available for all. Some suggested approaches include that the WHO programmes should achieve both health and peace dividends at the country level, by mainstreaming the Health for Peace approach. This was discussed as member states spoke on the Global Health for Peace Initiative at the the 75th World Health Assembly (WHA) in Switzerland, where delegates requested that re-elected Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus consult all members, to find a way forward for the implementation of WHO's report on the new Initiative. The first in-person Health Assembly since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic was held from May 22-28, 2022 under the theme - Health for Peace, Peace for Health.
