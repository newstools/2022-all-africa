The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) have urged their members to return to work following a "productive" meeting with power utility Eskom. This comes after unsanctioned strike action forced Eskom to implement stage 6 load shedding to ease strain on the national grid. Eskom warned that although workers may be returning to work, the power system will not automatically return to some form of stability. "It is important to note that while the workforce might have returned to work by [Wednesday], the system will still take some time to recover. As a result of the strike, maintenance work has had to be postponed, and this backlog will take time to clear," the statement read.
