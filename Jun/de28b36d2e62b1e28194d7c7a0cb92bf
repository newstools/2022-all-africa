The former deputy senate president Ike Ekweremadu and his wife Beatrice Nwanneka Ekweremadu have been charged with plotting to traffic a 15-year-old boy to Britain to harvest his organs. Premium Times reported that the prosecutors said the Ekweremadus were being charged for bringing a 15-year-old boy from Nigeria to the UK with the claim that he was to be given a better life in the UK but was actually to harvest his kidney for their sick daughter. Prosecutors also accused them of forging documents to make the teen appear to be 21 years old but they discovered that he was 15 years old. However, the Nigerian Immigration Service confirmed the age of the alleged victim of organ harvesting as 21, contradicting the claims of prosecutors in London. The trial of the Ekweremadus continues on July 7 in the UK.
