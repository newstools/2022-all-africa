Namibian authorities have identified several suspects linked to the theft of nearly U.S.$4 million from South African President President Cyril's Phala Phala farm in Limpopo in 2020, investigative journalism unit, AmaBhungane reports. Speaking on the identification of the suspects, investigative reporter Sam Sole said: "We have information from the Namibian authorities showing that some of the suspects in this matter transferred six million rands or six million Namibian dollars from the South African accounts to Namibian accounts. It seem very likely that that six million was not the full amount. The indication is that other money was physically smuggled. So, whether it was one million U.S. dollars of four million U.S. dollars, the issue is neither here nor there." This comes after former Correctional Services Commissioner, Arthur Fraser, released a media statement that he had laid criminal charges against the President, alleging that Ramaphosa was "concealing the crime" from police and the South African Revenue Service. Fololwing the theft, Fraser claims that Ramaphosa "thereafter paid the culprits for their silence", allegations that have been dismissed by the Presidency.
