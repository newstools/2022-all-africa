Nigeria's human rights record is "very poor" and is "worse than [the] average in sub-Saharan Africa," a new report by an international organization Human Rights Measurement Initiative has said. The HRMI "Rights Tracker" is the first global report to assess the 13 different human rights contained in United Nations treaties for around 200 countries. The report stated that Nigeria's mismanagement of resources is largely responsible for the country's rarely improving human rights crises. "Compared with other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Nigeria is performing worse than average," the report said, confirming what observers and rights advocates are saying about the Nigerian state's human rights record and the daily experience of Nigerians.
