The 26th Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) has kicked off in Kigali. The meeting, which was initially due to take place in 2020 before it was postponed twice due to the Covid-19 pandemic, will last a week with dozens of sessions scheduled at different venues across the city. Rwanda is the youngest member of the 54-nation community having joined in 2009, six years after it launched its bid. Rwanda became the second country to join the Commonwealth without having been a British colony - after Mozambique. This is the first CHOGM in four years, the last having taken place in London. Philip Murphy, a professor of Commonwealth history, examines the expectations and limitations of the Kigali conference for The Conversation Africa.
