Neglected Tropical Diseases and Malaria have caused suffering to communities worldwide, especially in Africa. NTDs are a diverse group of 20 conditions that are caused by a variety of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi, and toxins. More than a billion people are affected by neglected tropical diseases globally. Africa accounts for nearly 40% (400 million people) of the global burden. At least 600,000 people are still being killed every year by malaria alone, most of them young children in sub-Saharan Africa.  World leaders have begun the process of committing to and endorsing the Kigali Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). The declaration is a high-level statement meant to mobilize the necessary political will, community commitment, financial resources, and individual action to end NTDs. The Kigali Declaration will be launched at the Kigali Summit on Malaria and NTDs, held on the sidelines of this month's 26th Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Rwanda.   In Kigali, government officials, leading African and global medical research institutions, civil society, and the pharmaceutical industry will discuss concrete actions to tackle NTDs, including supporting medical research to develop more effective lifesaving tools - in line with the targets of the World Health Organisation (WHO) NTD Roadmap to eliminate 20 diseases as public health problem by 2030. Malaria and NTDs continue to afflict the lives and livelihoods of billions of people, with half the world at risk from Malaria and 1 in 5 at risk from NTDs. These diseases cause ill health, disability, disfigurement and a shocking number of deaths each year. They also prevent children from going to school and adults from working, costing endemic countries billions of dollars in lost economic output.
