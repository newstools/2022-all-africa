KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Sihle Zikalala, has said substantial progress has been made in restoring water and power supply in areas affected by the recent floods. Zikalala expressed his gratitude to the Gift of the Givers foundation, which has donated 14 boreholes, with 11 already having been drilled. Meanwhile, the Department of Public Enterprises hailed Transnet Freight Rail for the "significant progress" made in repairs to its Durban Rail and Ports. "The recovery from the damage caused by the flooding in KwaZulu-Natal will enable exporters and importers that utilise the Port of Durban to return to normality and Transnet will endeavour that all shipping lines continue to service the Port of Durban," the department said in a statement. The floods - which were described as the worst that the province has seen, killed at least 430 people and displaced thousands more - have prompted calls by the Public Service Commission (PSC) for a 'Disaster Fund'. The PSC said that this is to ensure adequate resourcing of socio-economic relief packages for future pandemics or disasters.
