Climate activists have demanded answers from Standard Bank for its involvement and continued support for oil and gas projects on the African continent, even as the worst effects of the climate crisis are being seen and felt. Activist shareholders and NGOs attended the company's annual general meeting to question executives about the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP), it's involvement in gas extraction in Mozambique and support for future oil and gas projects in the region. This comes amid increasing pressure on the financiers of fossil fuel projects such as banks, insurers and other financial players who are key to future development projects.
