The Mozambican government has prohibited the import of animals, and animal products and by-products from Zimbabwe due to the resurgence of cases of foot and mouth disease. This comes after the Zimbabwean Tax Authority notified the Mozambican authorities on the outbreak in Mashonaland Central province's Mbire district, which borders Mozambique. The Mozambique government has also decided to ban the import wild ungulates, as well as fodder for cattle, goats, pigs and sheep. Foot and mouth disease is classified as one of the most dangerous livestock diseases in the world because of its rapid transmission and spread, with very negative economic impact.
