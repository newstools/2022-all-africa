Martina Schwikowski for Deutsche Welle reports that every year, African countries miss out on vast sums of taxpayers' money due to a lack of logistical support for business transactions and monitoring systems. However, the real problem is that much of the working population is employed in the informal sector: on markets, in agriculture, the arts and craft industry, in the construction sector, or in transport. Moreover, many small, independent businesses are not registered - self-employed people often pay neither taxes nor social security contributions. If they were collected, more tax revenues could significantly improve health and education, expand infrastructure, and contribute to other urgently needed development projects in many African countries.           According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), 2 billion people work in the informal economy globally, and in Africa, 85.5% of the population does. In sub-Saharan Africa, this percentage rises to 90% according to the World Bank, accounting for 40% of the (Gross National Product) GNP. Thus, it is neither efficient nor fair, says the bank.
