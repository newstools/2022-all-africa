The government has released new guidelines for the operation of social media multinationals in the country - including Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and other platforms.  The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) spokesperson Hadiza Umar said, the new code was designed to protect the "fundamental human rights of Nigerians and non-Nigerians living in the country, as well as define guidelines for interacting on the digital ecosystem." Online platforms will be required to register and open offices in Nigeria and appoint contact persons with the government, the draft regulations from the information technology development agency, show. In addition, NITDA said the platforms would be required to provide to users or authorised government agencies, relevant information for the preservation of security and public order. Nigeria suspended Twitter in June 2021 for several months after the social media network deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari. As a result, the government said it would sit down with a panel from Twitter to come up with a set of conditions to allow them to operate in the country.
