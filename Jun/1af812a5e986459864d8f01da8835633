Long-term uncertainty related to the length of the transition period in Mali has made it even more difficult to achieve progress on implementing the 2015 peace agreement.           Although the West African country continues to face political, security and humanitarian challenges, "they are far from being insurmountable," El-Ghassim Wane, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Mali told the Security Council.           United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) has been actively involved in efforts aimed at overcoming the deadlock over the transition to civilian rule in Mali, where the military seized power in a coup nearly two years ago.           The 18-month political transition was supposed to conclude in March 2022, prompting regional bloc ECOWAS to impose sanctions on the country.           Insecurity remains a concern in Mali. Wane paid tribute to peacekeepers who died serving with MINUSMA since it was established nearly a decade ago.           The security situation remains volatile, particularly in central Mali, and along its borders with Burkina Faso and Niger, known as the Liptako-Gourma region.
