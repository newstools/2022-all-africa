The Lagos State Government has deployed officers, Anti-Okada Squad, to different parts of the state to prevent the breakdown of law and order in the enforcement of the ban on commercial motorcyclists called Okada. Effective from June 1, 2022, the Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, banned the activities of the motorcyclists, in six local governments - Ikeja, Surulere, Eti-Osa, Lagos Mainland, Lagos Island, and Apapa. The governor said that motorcycle taxi services in Lagos are unsafe. As the enforcement begins, the Lagos Ferry Services said it has deployed more boats and increased daily operational trips at terminals and jetties located within areas in the state where activities of commercial motorcyclists have been banned.
