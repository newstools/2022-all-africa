The High Court in London ruled on June 10, 2022 that deportations of asylum-seekers in the UK to Rwanda can proceed next week, writes Deutsche Welle. While British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: "Rwanda will have the capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people in the years ahead", the UN Refugee Agency has criticised the British plan, saying it violates the international Refugee Convention. The Rwandan government has meanwhile unveiled three of five facilities with over 700 beds, that is expected to host migrants and asylum seekers sent from the UK, writes Aurore Teta Ufitiwabo for New Times. Several Rwandans have reportedly embarked on a hunger strike at a detention centre in the UK, after hearing of their deportation.
