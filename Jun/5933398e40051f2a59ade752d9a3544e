Chima Williams has for years confronted powerful oil majors who degraded the Niger Delta environment. As an environmental lawyer, he has won multiple precedent-setting cases in the last 20 years, the latest being a January 2021 Dutch appeals court delivered victory against Royal Dutch Shell. The victory is the first time a Dutch transnational corporation was held accountable for the violations of its subsidiary in another country,  and opened Shell to legal action from Nigerian communities devastated by the firm's disregard for environmental safety. Williams who is the executive director of Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria, was named one of the winners of the prestigious Goldman Prize for his work - the third Nigerian to win the prize after Ken Saro Wiwa and Odigha Odigha, writes Ini Ekott for Premium Times.
