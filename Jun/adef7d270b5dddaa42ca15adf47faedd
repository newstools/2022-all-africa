We are fast running out of time to slash carbon emissions and limit the worst effects of the climate crisis, and this means that moving away from fossil fuels is both a challenge and an opportunity. Turning necessity into opportunity, Nigerian entrepreneur Olukokun Tolulope launched ThinkElectric Africa, an electric vehicle company, with a mission to accelerate Africa's transition to renewable energy and sustainable transport. He also runs Thinkbikes - a micromobility company that is manufacturing two and three-wheelers locally for last-mile transportation of goods and people. Researchers say electric vehicles need to be combined with a much greater effort to make cities bikeable and walkable to curb climate emissions.
