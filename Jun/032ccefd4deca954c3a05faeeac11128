President Yoweri Museveni has said the issue of high commodity prices will soon be dealt with easily. The country is experiencing high fuel prices which has now shifted to the increased prices of soap, detergents and sugar among other household commodities. The president said having done a careful analysis of the situation, government has decided to avoid tax waivers and provision of subsidies but rather adopt other strategies. Meanwhile, opposition leader and National Unity Platform (NUP) president Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, also known as Bobi Wine, criticised Museveni's State House expenditure, saying that "as the country reels under rising inflation, public money is being spent on upgrades, leaving Ugandans to fight for survival". Wine also criticised Museveni's government for failing to provide tangible solutions to inflation in the country, while government officials continue to live luxuriously.
