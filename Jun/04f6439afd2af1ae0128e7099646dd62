The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the 2023 elections, Atiku Abubakar, has announced Delta State governor Ifeanyi Okowa as his running mate and gave reasons for his choice.  In his speech announcing the running mate in Abuja, Abubabakr said his vice-president "must have an appreciation of the deep rot which our country has been put into by the rudderless All Progressives Congress government and also "appreciate the critical importance of education in the development of modern societies so we can prepare our young people to be able to compete in the increasingly competitive and globalized world". He also listed other qualities his running mate must have, including symbolizing "the imperative of reuniting our country but also being able to work with me to achieve that objective". Abubakar is taking his sixth shot at the top post.
