UN Secretary-General António Guterres has strongly condemned an attack in Burkina Faso that left dozens of civilians dead and displaced scores more.           Armed men launched an overnight assault on the town of Seytenga, located in the Sahel region in the north of the country.           Speaking previously, Guterres said that terrorism threat in Africa is increasing. Extremist groups such as Al-Qaida and Da'esh, and their affiliates, are continuing to grow in the Sahel region and are making inroads into Central and Southern Africa.
