For far too long, we've been telling the story on how climate change is real and man-made, how human-produced pollution is causing it, and how there is overwhelming scientific consensus that this is true. Mainstream news companies have gotten better at saying "it's genuine" and "experts agree" after decades of carelessly portraying a scientific problem as a two-sided political dispute. In a similar vein, after years of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, warning of catastrophic fires, droughts, and storms, we are now skilled at emphasising how "terrible" things have already gotten. So what do we do now? As Kenyans prepare for the August 9, 2022 polls, unlike in the past where environmental concerns and the dangers of climate change didn't frequently appear during campaigns and in political party manifestos, this has to change now. Surely manifestos that give the way forward on climate change mitigation and adaptation, and provide mechanisms for addressing the issue, would be a good start.
