President Yoweri Museveni has met and held discussions with a Special Envoy from Algeria, Ramtane Lamamra who is also the North African country's Minister for Foreign Affairs, in a meeting that was also attended by the State Minister of Foreign Affairs of Uganda, John Mulimba. They discussed bilateral cooperation between the two countries in the fields of trade, agriculture and security, among others. Museveni used this opportunity to lobby the Algerians to invest in Uganda especially in agricultural value addition but also asked the North African country to start importing milk from Uganda. In response, Lamamra said that Algeria is regaining its strength and economic independence, noting that both countries need to do more when it comes to cooperation especially in the field of trade. The envoy said that a business council has been established to discuss what Uganda can sell to Algeria and what Algeria can sell to Uganda.
