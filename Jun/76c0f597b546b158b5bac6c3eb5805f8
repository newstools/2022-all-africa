Gunmen have released 11 passengers who were abducted during a train attack in March, though dozens of others are thought to remain in captivity. The captives were freed in return for eight of the assailants' children, who had been seized by the army, following weeks of negotiations with the authorities. On March 28, 2022, gunmen blew up the tracks of the moving train on the Abuja-Kaduna route and opened fire on passengers scrambling to safety. Nine people were killed and dozens went missing. Nigeria's state railway company initially said it could not account for 168 people who according to a passenger log had booked to travel on the train. Most were later traced to their homes, but 65 were confirmed missing. President Muhammadu Buhari has addressed the widespread insecurity caused by armed gangs in his speech marking the country's democracy day. He described the "daily grief and worry" he feels for the victims of "terrorism and kidnapping" and said his government would continue to seek justice for the families of victims.
