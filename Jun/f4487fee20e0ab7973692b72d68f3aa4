The Angolan Government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are creating conditions for resuming the repatriation of refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo sheltered at Lóvua locality, in Angola's north-east region. According to the head office of UNHCR in Lunda Norte Province, Chrispus Tebid the resumption of the process is because ethnic and political conflicts in some parts of DRC have been overcome, especially in Kassai region. The Angolan Government with the UNHCR assistance is conducting a survey to determine the number of refugees that want to return to their country of origin. The government assured those who wish to remain in Angola, due to several reasons that they will still be assisted. In June 2017 Angola recorded the highest migratory flow observing the entry of 31,241 DRC citizens, due to the political and ethnic conflicts in that country. However, in 2018 it recorded the voluntary return of 11,758 citizens. Currently, in Lóvua field there are 6,998 refugees, of whom 5,582 are children from 0 to 17 years old.
