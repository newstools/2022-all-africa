A new report from a civil society observer group says that despite successful multi-national military action against insurgents in the northern province of Cabo Delgado, "the pattern of violence across the province shows that when forces attempt to clear insurgents from a district, they simply withdraw and appear elsewhere." It adds that the fact "that insurgent groups can still circulate around Cabo Delgado with apparent freedom also reflects a poor level of strategic coordination between international forces that are each responsible for their own operational areas."
