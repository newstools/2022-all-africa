June 8 every year is World Oceans Day. The theme for 2022 is Revitalization: collective action for the ocean. This day is a reminder of the role oceans play in every day life. According to the UN News Service, world leaders, youth, entrepreneurs and civil society will meet in Lisbon, Portugal for the second UN Oceans Conference, co-hosted by Kenya, later in June 2022. The aim of this conference will be to mobilise action and jumpstart science-based innovative solutions aimed at starting a new chapter of global ocean action.  This comes as Africa battles against over-fishing in countries like Kenya, where artisinal fishers battle for their livelihoods against huge foreign fishing vessels, or where oil spills in countries like Mauritius has seen livelihoods and tourism impacted.
