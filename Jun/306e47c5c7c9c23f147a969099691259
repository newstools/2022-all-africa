Millions of displaced families across the world will fall deeper into hunger as food rations dwindle due to humanitarian resources being stretched to the limit, while funding struggles to keep pace, says the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) on World Refugee Day.  The sombre warning comes as World Food Programme has already been forced to significantly reduce rations to refugees across its operations. "As global hunger soars way beyond the resources available to feed all the families who desperately need WFP's help, we are being forced to make the heartbreaking decision to cut food rations for refugees who rely on us for their survival," said David Beasley, Executive Director of the World Food Programme. Severe funding constraints in West Africa, where hunger has reached a record high in a decade, have forced WFP to significantly reduce rations for refugees living in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. WFP assists on average 500,000 refugees in Southern Africa annually. Despite generous support from donors, resourcing remains insufficient to meet the very basic needs of refugee households and imminent disruptions are expected in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Republic of Congo, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. "Without urgent new funds to support refugees - one of the world's most vulnerable and forgotten groups of people - many facing starvation will be forced to pay with their lives," Beasley warned. World Refugee Day is observed annually on 20 June to create awareness about the challenges these people face.
