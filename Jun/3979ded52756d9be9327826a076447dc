The informal plastic recycling sector in Kenya does not fairly compensate waste pickers making it a very exploitative circular economy. Mr Green Africa is changing that by purchasing directly from their sourcing agents or waste pickers, who are some of society's most marginalised people. To mitigate the effects of climate change, the linear process of extracting materials from the earth to produce goods that end up as waste is being remodeled into a sustainable loop. In a circular economy, three principles are upheld: stop the production of waste and pollution in the first place, circulate existing products and materials to prolong use and slow down the rate of disposal and regenerate nature. It dissociates economic activity from the consumption of finite resources to renewable energy materials that are good for business, communities, and the environment. The circular economy gives us the tools to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss together while addressing important social needs. By dealing directly with waste pickers MGA is formalising the sector using technology-enabled information flow and transactions that provide reliable pricing and significant income improvement, reports Kylie Kiunguyu for This is Africa.
