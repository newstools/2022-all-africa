Over just the last two weeks, insurgents in the province of Cabo Delgado have been active in four districts which never suffered guerrilla attacks before, reports Joseph Hanlon. Apart from moving south into new areas of the province, they have crossed into Nampula province for the first attacks south of Cabo Delgado. Islamic State is increasingly claiming involvement, giving the attacks an anti-Christian aspect, burning churches and killing Catholic civilians. For example, in the attack on Retene, Chiúre, IS said it had killed "two Christians and burnt down 70 houses and their churches".
