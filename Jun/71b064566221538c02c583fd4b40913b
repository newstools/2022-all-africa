Bicycles are a popular way to get around in Chipata in the east of Zambia, but they didn't become popular because of residents' desire to save the environment but because bicycle taxis are cheaper, faster and more convenient, writes Deogracias Kalima for Africa Renewal. However, since 2010 when the city began to gain attention because of the sheer number of bicycles plying the roads, residents have become more conscious of the fact that riding bikes is environmentally friendly. Of Zambia's 116 districts, Chipata District has the highest number of bicycles. Paul Nayombe, a retired Chipata city councillor, estimates up to 3,000 bicycle taxis in the city.
