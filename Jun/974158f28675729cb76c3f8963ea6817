A first-time driver on Kenyan roads is likely to think that commercial and passenger service vehicles are highly regulated, as drivers are frequently stopped by traffic police along Kenya's highways. A number of reports on traffic police corruption in Kenya have been drawn up. However, first-hand data on corrupt transactions at checkpoints and roadblocks are not easy to come by. Bribery at traffic stops is a means to cope and fit within the elaborate network in the police hierarchy.            Motorists - who are equally complicit - often find the legal landscape too time-consuming and costly to pursue cases. Mini bus taxi owners reported that their vehicles were targeted or their drivers frustrated after a court process, resulting in a difficult, if not impossible, environment to run a business, reports Gedion Onyango for The Conversation.
