June 12 was declared Democracy Day by the Buhari administration to celebrate the late Chief MKO Abiola's victory in the presidential election on June 12, 1993 - judged as the most fair elections held in the country. The annulment of the election by the General Ibrahim Babagida junta followed, resulting in a struggle by pro-democracy activists supported by labour unions and student associations, among other pressure groups, to revalidate that election. In its shift to civilian rule following the death of military leader Sani Abacha in June 1998, a month before Abiola died in prison, Nigerians were promised dividends of democracy - good governance, rule of law, respect for human rights and social justice, a fight against corruption, economic empowerment and a better standard of living which they felt were denied them under the military junta. However this has largely still not materialised for many Nigerians, writes Leadership. Now as the 2023 election race heats up, today's celebrations provides a fertile ground for President Muhammadu Buhari; presidential aspirants of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu and that of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, to set the pace for their campaigns ahead of the 2023 general election. Nigerians live in hope that the dividends will materialise this time around.
