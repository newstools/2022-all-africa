Belgium's King Philippe arrived in the DR Congo on June 7, 2022 - his first visit since succeeding his father King Albert II on July 21, 2013. The monarch's visit comes two years after he apologised for atrocities committed during Belgium's brutal colonial era. The six-day trip has been billed as a chance for reconciliation between the two nations. The Belgian delegation will meet with President Felix Tshisekedi, to discuss the colonial past as well as current political relations.            The monarch is scheduled to deliver speeches at Kinshasa on June 8, 2022 at a ceremony with the president at the Congolese parliament, and on June 10 will address students at the University of Lubumbashi.           Historians have said that millions of people in the Belgian Congo were killed, mutilated or died of disease as they worked on rubber plantations belonging to Leopold II, Belgium's monarch from 1865-1909 and the brother of Philippe's great great grandfather. King Philippe's visit was originally scheduled for June 2020 to mark the DR Congo's 60th year of independence, but was rescheduled to 2022 due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.
