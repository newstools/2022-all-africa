The Zamfara State Government has asked residents to "obtain guns to defend themselves against armed militants and bandits who have been carrying out a growing number of kidnappings for ransom and murders."  The attacks have increased since the start of the year. Zamfara and neighboring Kaduna are the most affected, authorities say. Premium Times reports that Zamfara and Katsina are two of the states most affected by the activities of terrorists, locally called bandits, whose actions have led to the deaths of hundreds of people and the kidnap of thousands of others. Zamfara State also banned the use of motorcycles and selling of petrol in three districts and one emirate, in areas which are the most affected by banditry.
