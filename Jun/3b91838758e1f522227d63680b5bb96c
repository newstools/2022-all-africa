On June 14, 2022 the Military Committee headed by the Deputy President of the Sovereignty Council Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo 'Hemeti' and Council member Lt Gen Shamseldin Kabbashi, met with the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF) representatives to discuss their stance on the process of the direct dialogue proposed by the AU-IGAD-UN Trilateral Mechanism.           (SRF) an alliance of rebel movements that signed the Juba Peace Agreement in the South Sudanese capital in October 2020, have agreed on a one-stage Sudanese-Sudanese dialogue - though the SRF initiative originally provided for a dialogue of several stages.           Lt Gen Ibrahim Jaber said in a press statement following the meeting that the two parties agreed to support the Trilateral Mechanism initiative and lead the dialogue through a national committee that includes all parties. The meeting also confirmed the Juba Peace Agreement, and stressed the importance of implementing all its stipulations.           The United Sudanese Revolutionary Forces Abroad (USRFA), a revolutionary coordination body of more than 31 Sudanese bodies and entities across the world, expressed their disappointment and rejection of the Trilateral AU-IGAD-UNITAMS negotiations with the coup government.
