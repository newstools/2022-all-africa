Allegations of the forced eviction of indigenous communities in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA) in northern Tanzania are spurious and misleading, according to Freddy Manongi, conservation commissioner of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority and Kaush Arha who previously served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Wildlife and Parks. According to the two experts, the government's proposal of making 521,000 hectares of prime land available for voluntary resettlement outside of the NCA protected area in 2022, will see approximately 40,000 people from 8,000 households take up the offer which they say, will benefit their communities. Each household will receive a 3-bedroom home on 2.5 acres with additional 5 acres of agricultural land plus the use of communal grazing lands. Resettled communities will also have schools, medical centres, marketplaces and recreational facilities. The NCA will offer food supplies to resettled families for up to 18 months to ensure smooth transition. Separate incentives of cash and relocation costs are offered to the NCA households who want to relocate to land of their own choosing. The NCA is recognised as a World Heritage Site, World Biosphere Reserve and Global Geopark covering 8,292 square kilometres. Its southern rim is marked by the world-famous trio of extinct volcanic craters - Ngorongoro, Olmoti and Empakai - and unique cloud highland forests.
