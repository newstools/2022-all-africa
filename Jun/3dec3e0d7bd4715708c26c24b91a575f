Over the last several years, major cities such as Cape Town, Sao Paulo and Barcelona have faced 'Day Zero' scenarios, characterised by the very real possibility of running out of water. As the world continues its urbanising trend, there are important lessons to be learned from these water crises: Why do they happen, what was the impact and the response? These lessons will be central to tackling future urban water-related risks and vulnerabilities especially given the uncertainties created by increased climate change and variability. In Towards the Blue-Green City: Building Urban Water Resilience, a diverse set of scholars reflect on the causes and consequences of Cape Town's near 'Day Zero' event and the lessons to be learned for cities around the world.
