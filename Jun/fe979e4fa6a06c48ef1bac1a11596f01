In the final report of the four-year Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, Chief Justice Zondo made several observations on decisions and actions taken by President Ramaphosa while deputy president of the country. The report stated that Ramaphosa, who faced heavy criticism in the document, had the responsibility to know more than he claimed to from media and civil society regarding allegations of corruptions against the Gupta family. Meanwhile, the ruling African National Congress (ANC) said that any members implicated in the report would face the party's integrity commission. This comes after the report examined cadre deployment and how the ANC handled state capture allegations. The initial release of the report sent shockwaves from an 87-page examination of how former president Jacob Zuma and his accomplices captured the South African Revenue Service. The report recommended prosecution against former high-ranking lawmakers and their public and private sector affiliates. It also called for greater protection of whistleblowers and the establishment of a single, multifunctional, properly resourced and independent anti-corruption authority by the government, with a mandate to "confront the abuses inherent in the present system".
