President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged the next administration to use debt - emphasising its importance - as a key accelerator of economic development. Kenyatta, while delivering his last national event speech during the Madaraka Day fete, defended the Jubilee Party's decision to borrow more, noting that it helped to "close our infrastructure gap and connect our markets." His remarks come as the National Treasury proposed an increase in debt ceiling from the current U.S.$77 billion to U.S.$86 billion, to enable the government to borrow more to finance the U.S.$28 billion budget for the 2022/23 financial year. A huge chunk has gone to infrastructure projects - key of which is the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) whose contracts, agreements and studies related to the construction and operations of the SGR, are not yet open to the public.
