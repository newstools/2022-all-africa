Landfill sites pose a variety of risks to humans and the environment, as well as the possibility of releasing toxic leachate or fluids into our groundwater. But turning rotting food scraps such as tea leaves, eggshells, fruit, and vegetable peels, into compost is an amazing way to repurpose waste and turn trash into nutrient-dense organic matter that helps plants grow while protecting the environment. In the face of climate change, more people are looking for ways to conserve the environment. Many people are now using food scraps as fertiliser through a process called vermicomposting. Vermicomposting or vermiculture, also known as worm composting, is the process of having earthworms eat organic material, such as vegetable and fruit peels, and then break it down through digestion to produce high-quality fertiliser, reports Melody Chironda for allAfrica.
