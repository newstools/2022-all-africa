In early June 2022, more than 30 people from the Maasai community in the Loliondo division in Tanzania's northern Ngorongoro District were reportedly injured, and one person died following clashes with security forces over the demarcation of their ancestral lands for a new game reserve. According to human rights organisations, the Maasai community was blocking eviction from its grazing sites at Lolionda over the demarcation of 1 500km of the Maasai ancestral land, which the government of Tanzania has leased as a hunting block to a United Arab Emirates company. The eviction of the Maasai is a realisation of fears indigenous communities have about the loss of their ancestral lands under the '30by30' plan proposed in the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). The plan calls for conserving 30% of the earth's land and sea areas. Close to 100 countries have endorsed the science-backed proposal to protect 30 percent of the planet by 2030, which is target 3 of the 21 targets in the GBF. The fourth meeting of the Open-Ended Working Group on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework opened in Nairobi, (June 21-26), hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The meeting is expected to negotiate the final new pact for adoption at the United Nations Biodiversity Conference, which includes the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to be held in Montreal, Canada in December 2022. Experts have warned that the success of the post-2020 GBF depends on adequate financing to achieve the targets and goals in the framework.
