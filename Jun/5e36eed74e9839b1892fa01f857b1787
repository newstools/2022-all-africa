On May 24, 2022 Swiss oil trading giant Glencore admitted to a U.S. court via virtual link, that it had paid nearly one hundred million dollars in bribes to officials and public agents in eight countries around the world. In Africa the goal was to obtain and retain contracts with public and state-controlled entities in the West African countries of Nigeria, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, and Equatorial Guinea.           In some countries these admissions are causing a stir, but not so much in Cote d'Ivoire, where Glencore admits it bribed oil sector officials with up to U.S.$4 million between 2007 and 2010, during Laurent Gbagbo's presidency. According to the Swiss trader, Glencore made U.S.$30 million in profits, on the purchase of oil shipments. It is not known which officials benefited from these bribes.           In July 2021 a Premuim Times report detailed how a former UK-based trader for Glencore Plc, Anthony Stimler, bribed officials in Nigeria in exchange for favourable contracts from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC.           Helen Clark, the president of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (ITIE)  is calling on Côte d'Ivoire, Cameroon, the DR Congo and Nigeria to examine these cases, and to intervene quickly.
