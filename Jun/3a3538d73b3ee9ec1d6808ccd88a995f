Following an attack on a Catholic church in Ondo State which left scores of people dead and many injured, some women's groups under the umbrella of Womanifesto, gave the Nigerian government four weeks to put an end to the incessant killings across the country. The group also called on the government to, "publish the identities of all the victims of the Ondo state tragedy - those who died and those who were injured - and to demonstrate accountability and carry out a speedy investigation that is conclusive with arrests, successful judicial prosecution, and sentencing of the killers." Several individuals and organisations have since condemned the incident, including the Pope. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
