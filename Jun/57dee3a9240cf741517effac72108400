A commission of senior security and state officials from the troubled Central African Republic (CAR) and Cameroon has agreed to jointly fight armed rebels they say are fleeing intensive fighting and infiltrating refugee camps in Cameroon.           After concluding a meeting in the border town of Ngaoundere a city in Cameroon on the border with the CAR, the delegations said they will jointly deploy their forces to battle the proliferation of weapons, abductions, attacks for supplies and the illegal exploitation of minerals by rebels along their border.           Violence was pervasive in the CAR in 2013 when then-president, Francois Bozize was ousted by the Séléka, a coalition from the Muslim minority groups that accused him of breaking peace deals.           There are 14 rebel groups fighting against the CAR government, making peace efforts difficult.           According to the UN, the ongoing fighting has forced close to a million Central Africans to flee to neighbouring countries, including Cameroon, Chad, the DR Congo and Nigeria.
