Deutsche Welle reports that 10 African nations top a list of countries where people's suffering from displacement and conflict is internationally neglected, according to an annual ranking by the Norwegian Refugee Council. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most neglected country on the list for the second year running, followed by Burkina Faso, Cameroon and South Sudan. Some 5.5 million people were internally displaced in DR Congo in 2021 because of intercommunal tension and conflict, the report noted, with a further 1 million fleeing to neighboring countries. Having to flee their homes leaves people at risk of starvation and children without education and can prolong the conflicts and violence that are often responsible for the displacements in the first place. One-third of the population, or some 27 million people, went hungry in DR Congo in 2021. Chad, Mali, Sudan, Nigeria, Burundi and Ethiopia complete the list. As well as making it into the top 10 neglected crises list, Sudan and Nigeria, for example, are both towards the bottom of international press freedom rankings.
