European Union Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarcic on a visit to Tigray has said a lack of fuel is preventing delivery of much-needed humanitarian aid. However, a spokesperson for Ethiopia's prime minister told VOA that the idea of a fuel shortage in Tigray is a myth.           Lenarcic said at a news conference in Addis Ababa that the number of trucks bringing food to the regional capital, Mekelle, has almost reached the level necessary to cover the basic humanitarian needs of the people of Tigray. However, he said the aid effort needs more fuel so that humanitarian workers can deliver assistance to all in need. A spokesperson for Abiy, Billene Seyoum, said data available indicates that last week alone, three fuel tankers carrying over 137,500 liters of fuel arrived in Mekelle. Seyoum said that, in total, more than 920,000 liters of fuel have been sent to the region since April. "So, the myth of fuel shortage is a Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) hidden agenda to enhance mobility of its army in preparation for another round of conflict. Hence, there are no fuel sanctions and such claims need to be reviewed with clarity on the reality," he said. On its Twitter account, the Tigray External Affairs Office insists the level of aid being allowed into Tigray does not meet the region's needs. It says between April and early June, just over 770,000 liters of fuel have been allowed into Tigray.           In a text message to VOA, TPLF spokesperson Getachaw Reda accused the Abiy government of misrepresenting facts. He said the fuel shortage in Tigray is as vicious as creating unnecessary checkpoints or other obstacles aimed at hindering humanitarian access.
