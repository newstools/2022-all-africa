At least 35 teenage girls have been rescued from a "baby factory" hotel where they were used as sex slaves and their babies sold on the black market. In many cases, unmarried pregnant women are promised healthcare, only for their children to be taken away. In others, women are raped and made pregnant.  Four of the girls were pregnant, and some weapons and cash were recovered from the hotel. The police officers carried out the raid based on intelligence and tips from residents around the area. Three suspects, including two men who guarded the premises, and the assistant manager of the hotel, were arrested during the raid. In April 2018, police raided a baby factory and two unregistered orphanages in Lagos and rescued more than 160 children, some of whom had been sexually abused.
