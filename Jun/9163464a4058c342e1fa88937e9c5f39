Hassan Sheikh Mohamud has been inaugurated as the 10th president of Somalia in a colourful ceremony attended by hundreds of people, including the leaders of Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti. In his inaugural speech Mohamud, who previously served as president from 2012 to 2017, said that during his new term he will "ensure the rule of law is maintained, the judiciary is strengthened, people's confidence in government is restored and poverty will be tackled." He outlined his agenda for the next four years, saying he will prioritise reconciliation and the restoration of institutions to give citizens hope. The president warned that in addition to the danger posed by Al-Shabaab militants, severe drought poses an immediate threat to the country and there are fears that it could lead to famine. Drought has also impacted other countries in the region, including Ethiopia and Kenya. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes in search of food and water, and aid agencies have warned that an official declaration of famine may not be far away.
