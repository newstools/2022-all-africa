AllAfrica's Nontobeko Mlambo spoke to the International Monetary Fund's Deputy Managing Director Antoinette Sayeh who recently attended a high level conference co-organised with the African Union on the Promotion of Good Governance and Fight against Corruption. It follows on from the recent publication of a book titled - Good Governance in Sub-Saharan Africa: Opportunities and Lessons learnt that highlights the region's tremendous progress made in recent years to improve the standards of living of its citizens. Despite these wins, millions of people still face extremely difficult conditions, living in poverty and without access to sufficient public services, especially health care and education. These challenges have been made worse by the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
