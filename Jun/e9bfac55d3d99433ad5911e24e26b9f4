Nigeria Air has been granted an air transport licence by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority as it moves closer to launching operations. The carrier is now waiting for its air operator's certificate before commencing flights in July 2022. Nigeria announced its new national carrier back in July 2018 but suspending the project, which was revived again in 2021. The Acting CEO of Nigeria Air, Dapo Olumide said the certificate will enable them to push forward and conclude the process of starting the airline. He said the airline is aimed at restoring Nigerian pride, as one of the biggest countries in the aviation industry in Africa, and around the world.
