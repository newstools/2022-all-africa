Since Sudan's military coup on October 25, 2021 the UN mission in Sudan (UNITAMS) has tried to find a compromise to the country's political crisis. In January 2022, it launched a dialogue with the military and political parties, and it recently combined these negotiation efforts through the AU and the regional body, IGAD's mechanism. While most western nations have publicly supported the tripartite process, it has been rightly criticised by Sudanese activists and some political parties who see the mediation effort as legitimising the military coup.           The international community is trying to use a June 30, 2022   deadline for IMF and World Bank financing, to entice the military into an agreement.  In reality, the junta has made up the rules since the October 25 coup and lifting the state of emergency will have little effect on the continued takeover. Violence against protesters has continued. Desperate to make a deal, diplomats risk repeating their past mistakes, writes Justin Lynch for African Arguments.
