The Tanzanian government is working on a new user-friendly system in which harassed and abused children can report the abuse at the hands of perpetrators - 60% of whom are family members and 40% whom are at school. Ahead of the Day of the African Child to be celebrated on June 16 every year, Community Development Minister Dorothy Gwajima, asked children to come out and report abuse incidents by calling 116 toll-free. The minister assured that cases would be handled without disclosing the source. A number of interventions have been put in place, including the tightening of policies, regulations and guidelines to ensure the protection of children's rights. Police stations have been equipped with gender and children's desks countrywide, which will assist in fast-tracking child abuse cases and the arraignment of perpetrators. The number of juvenile courts have been increased from three in 2015, to 141 in January 2022.
