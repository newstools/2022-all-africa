The state needs to act urgently to address the increase of xenophobic groups across South Africa, write Godfrey Mulaudzi, Lizette Lancaster and Thato Machabaphala for the Institute for Security Studies. Since late 2021, attacks on foreign nationals in South Africa in areas such as Alexandra and Diepsloot have increased. These attacks could be the precursor of more widespread violence across the country if community vigilante groups are not reined in by law enforcement. In South Africa, the most violent and fatal manifestations of this targeted violence occurred in 2008 and 2015. These groups are motivated by persistent xenophobic beliefs stemming from myths and misconceptions about foreign nationals, particularly from within Africa and South Asia.
