Members of the East African Legislative Assembly are "disturbed" that the annual budget of the East African Community (EAC) continues to reduce, despite the region's economies having maintained an upward trend, writes James Karuhanga  for The New Times. This was noted by Betty Maina, the chairperson of the Council of Minister, who presented the EAC's U.S.$91,579, 215 budget for financial year 2022/2023, to the regional parliament in Arusha, Tanzania. Maina who is also Kenya's Cabinet Secretary for the EAC and Regional Development, noted that estimates for the next financial year was being presented in tough times, considering the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian - Ukrainian conflict. Priority interventions for the new budget, she said, will include peace security; private sector development and participation; economic integration; improvement of productivity, value addition, promotion of regional value chains, and local content; health; infrastructure development; and the region's digitisation agenda.
