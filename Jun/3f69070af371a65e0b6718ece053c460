The ruling junta in Guinea-Conakry has rejected a call from the UN to lift a ban on political demonstrations, insisting that protests should only be allowed during the election period in three years' time.           In a communiqué read on state television, the junta stated: "No march will be authorised so long as public order cannot be guaranteed." The Junta said that hundreds of people died during violent protests that erupted during Alpha Condé's years in power. It added that committees had already been set up, where "contradictions and misunderstandings can be debated quite serenely."           The military, which overthrew President Alpha Condé in September 2021, declared a ban on public demonstrations in May 2022, before any return to civilian rule - which it says will happen in three years time. The three-year transition period proposed by the military is in defiance of ECOWAS demands for a return to civilian rule within a much shorter time frame.
