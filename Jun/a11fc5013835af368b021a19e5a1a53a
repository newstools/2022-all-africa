The Residual Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals has ruled that key genocide suspect Felicien Kabuga, 87, is medically fit to stand trial at The Hague where he is currently detained, writes Bertrand Byishimo for The New Times. This follows the request by defence lawyers that Kabuga's trial proceedings be halted due to his ill health. The judges also ruled that Kabuga will remain detained at The Hague branch of the Mechanism - where he has been in custody since October 26, 2020. It had earlier been hoped that the man considered the mastermind of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi, would be transferred at the Arusha, Tanzania branch of the Mechanism. His arrest ended a 26-year search for Kabuga, who was considered a "big fish" by the Mechanism and its predecessor, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. Kabunga is facing seven counts, five of which is related to genocide: complicity in genocide, direct and public incitement to commit genocide, attempt to commit genocide and conspiracy to commit genocide, and genocide.
