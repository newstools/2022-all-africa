West Darfur has witnessed the signing of agreements to stop hostilities between Arab and Masalit tribes in El Geneina locality, and the Rizeigat and Iringa tribes in Sirba locality, in the presence of Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo 'Hemeti', Deputy Chairman of the Sovereignty Council and Commander-in-Chief of the Rapid Support Forces.           The Darfur Bar Association (DBA) dismissed the tribal reconciliation conferences in West Darfur as "mere political demonstrations that encourage impunity in the absence of the Rule of Law".           These conferences in the past "failed to stop the widespread tribal wars and disputes that often arise as a result of ordinary disputes between individuals. Tribes are then involved in them and all kinds of weapons which the state does not even possess are used in them," the Bar argued in a press statement.           "Experiences have proven that peace conferences and agreements on the payment of blood money of which civil administration leaders take a significant percentage, weakens the civil state, the Rule of Law, and the prestige of the state, and encourages the continuation of crimes, human rights violations, and homicide," the Darfur Bar Association stated.
