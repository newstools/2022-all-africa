Rights groups in Malawi have urged authorities to quickly find and deport a Chinese man who was found to be making and selling exploitative videos of children. A BBC investigation found the man, Lu Ke, paid children to sing and speak Mandarin in disturbing videos that he sold online.           Lu Ke taught the children phrases in which they praised Chinese people, made fun of poverty, and chanted a racist epithet saying they are "a black monster" and that their "IQ is low."           The Chinese embassy in Malawi has condemned the contents of the videos, saying it will work with the Malawian government to ensure the matter is properly addressed.           In the statement on its official social media platforms, the Chinese government further said it has noted the videos were shot in 2020 and that China has in recent years been cracking down on such unlawful online acts.           The investigation found that Lu Ke was shooting hundreds of videos per day and selling them at up to U.S.$70 apiece to a Chinese website. The kids performing in the videos were paid about half a dollar each.
