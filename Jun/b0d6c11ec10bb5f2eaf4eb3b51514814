Tax Transparency in Africa is a key output of the Africa Initiative, a programme established in 2014 to ensure that African countries are equipped to exploit the latest improvements in global transparency to better tackle tax evasion and other illicit financial flows. The launch is part of the 11th meeting of the Africa Initiative, slated for 14-16 June in Nairobi, Kenya. The conference will gather experts from tax administrations, regional and international organisations, academia, and civil society organisations. More on the AfDB's AllAfrica page.
