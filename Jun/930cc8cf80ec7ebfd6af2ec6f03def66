Deputy President William Ruto has vowed to ensure implementation of the entrenched two-thirds gender rule within the first three months if the Kenya Kwanza Alliance clinches the presidency. Speaking during the signing of the Kenya Kwanza Women Charter, the deputy president said he was aware that women make up the largest number of the population, and their needs ought to be well taken care of - both at national government and at county level. Ruto pledged to make women equal partners in his government, saying they will be the face of the Kenya Kwanza government. The Kenya Kwanza Alliance has already announced that if it forms the next government, more women will be appointed on the cabinet and other senior appointive posts. With the rising number of teenage pregnancies, Ruto further committed to ensure a comprehensive return to school formula for teenage mothers through bursary schemes, as well as providing sanitary hygiene products to all girls for free, reports Njoki Kihiu for Capital FM.
