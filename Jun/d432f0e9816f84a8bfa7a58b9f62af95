The United States is pressing African leaders to take sides in the war started by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But, writes William Minter, the veteran observer of Washington's policies on Africa, the war is a painful reminder for Africans that Western foreign policy priorities are still shaped primarily by racial bias and geopolitical rivalries rather than the urgent global issues that face the continent and the world. And, he adds, the reluctance of African governments to vote for Western resolutions at the United Nations, or take sides with Washington and its policy of military escalation, should not be seen as support for the Russian invasion or for Vladimir Putin.
