The Department of Justice and Correctional Services has confirmed the arrest of alleged State Capture masterminds Rajesh and Atul Gupta at Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. The India-born brothers are friends of former president Jacob Zuma. They have been accused of using their connections to Zuma to profit financially and influence senior government appointments. The pair deny any wrongdoing. The Gupta brothers left South Africa after Zuma was ousted in 2018. The Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture was established in 2018 to examine allegations against Zuma. Interpol issued a red notice for the Gupta's arrest in July 2021. The organisation said the Gupta brothers were being sought for fraud and money laundering in connection with a U.S.$1.6 million contract paid to a Gupta-linked company.
