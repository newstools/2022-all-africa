Liberia's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has said it stands by its preliminary findings on the water pollution incident in Grand Cape Mount county. The agency added that the findings were based on scientific analysis and data collected by well-trained technicians and scientists in the field. Bea Mountain Mining Corporation (BMMC) has however dismissed such reports. "BMMC categorically rejects and disagrees with the findings and claims being made by the EPA, as the degree and extent of testing conducted so far are inconclusive and filled with analytical gaps. We are confident and particularly reaffirm our position of being in no breach of any required scientific standards. We note that the EPA has found no evidence of damage to or any spill or irregular discharge from the TSF (trailings storage facility)" it said.           The EPA maintains the authenticity of the preliminary findings and the integrity of its work. The Agency said it would move ahead with plans to broaden the investigation, including the invitation of a third-party EPA-certified consultant or laboratory, to further determine how aquatic species had died off.
