The fighting between Mali's army and its Tuareg allies against Islamist militant groups in Mali's northeast Menaka region has intensified in the past weeks.           The fiercest battles are currently around Anderamboukane, a strategically important town near the border with Niger. The Movement for the Salvation of Azawad, a largely Tuareg militia, and its ally, the Imghad Tuareg and Allies Self-Defense Group, known as GATIA, are trying to push the extremists out of Anderamboukane and the surrounding area.           The local wing of extremist group known as the Islamic State has killed hundreds in the area since March, in retaliation for attacks by the Tuareg militias. The extremists have also looted and burned homes, markets and vehicles.           Many pastoralists in the region have also lost the animals they make their livelihoods from in the fighting, according to Ibrahima Garigo, director of the regional station Radio Rurale de Meneka, in a telephone interview with DW.
