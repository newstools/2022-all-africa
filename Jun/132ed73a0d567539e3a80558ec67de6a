Archaeologists spend a lot of time examining the remains of distant pasts, which includes the study of rock paintings, writes Neil Rusch and Sarah Wurz for The Conversation. A new study revealed a rock painting from the Cederberg Mountains in South Africa's Western Cape Province. The human figures in this painting have previously been interpreted as healers holding fly-whisks and doing a trance dance. Fly-whisks were an important accessory for the dance because they were thought to keep arrows of sickness at bay. But results suggest that the fly-whisks are in fact musical instruments of a type known as a !goin !goin - a name that only exists in the now-extinct ÇÂÂÂÂXam language that was spoken by hunter-gatherers in central southern Africa. The !goin !goin is an aerophone; these instruments produce sound by creating vibrations in the air when they are spun around.
