The United Nations and the Somali government have warned that severe drought is putting some areas in central and southern Somalia at an increased risk of famine as acute food insecurity, malnutrition and mortality worsens.           The country is experiencing the worst drought since the 2011 famine, following the failure of three consecutive rainy seasons - resulting in the destruction of livestock and crops.           According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification jointly released by the Somalia government, aid agencies and food security experts, the situation will worsen through at least September if the current Gu season (late March to June) crop and livestock production fails, food prices continue to rise sharply and humanitarian assistance is not scaled up to reach those most in need.           Somalia has called on the international community to participate in the ongoing emergency assistance to the drought-affected people in the country.
