The United Nation Children's Fund says more than 266,000 violations were committed against children in armed conflict between 2005 and 2020. An analysis of more than 30 conflicts across Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America found that children continue to bear the brunt of war and are forced to endure what it calls unspeakable horrors. Tasha Gill - a UNICEF's senior adviser - says that children are victims of a staggering average of 71 verified grave violations every day. The report has verified at least 25,700 child abductions by parties to conflict and more than 93,000 children recruited as soldiers by all parties to conflict. Gill says the report documents the killing and maiming of more than 104,000 children in conflict. She notes that abduction often leads to other violations, such as recruitment and sexual violence. Additionally, the report says children have been raped, forcibly married and sexually exploited, with at least 14,200 children also having been subjected to other forms of sexual violence.
