A federal court in Abuja has granted a request by Abba Kyari, the detained deputy commissioner of police, to file more evidence to challenge a suit by the Nigerian government seeking to extradite him to U.S. to face fraud charges. Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, filed the extradition proceedings against Kyari, seeking the court's approval to surrender him to the U.S. government. The U.S. demanded Kyari's extradition in April 2021 for his alleged involvement in the U.S.$1.1 million wire fraud by fraudster Ramon Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi. Kyari is accused of agreeing to detain one of Hushpuppi's co-conspirators after they had fallen out.   Kyari is also facing separate drug charges in Nigeria after being accused by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency of being a member of an international drug cartel. Kyari was lauded as Nigeria's most decorated cop in charge of the police's Intelligence Response Team until his suspension. He was conferred with a presidential medal for courage by Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari in 2016 and became known as "supercop".
