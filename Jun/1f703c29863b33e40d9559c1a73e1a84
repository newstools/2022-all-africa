The Helen Suzman Foundation (HSF) is taking the Minister of Home Affairs Aaron Motsoaledi to court to set aside government's decision to terminate the Zimbabwean Exemption Permit (ZEP) at the end of the year, Tania Broughton of GroundUp reports.           About 178,000 ZEP holders will find themselves undocumented. As will thousands of children who have been born in South Africa to ZEP holders. The foundation says the decision was taken without fair process and for political expediency.           "They will be put to a desperate choice: to remain in South Africa as undocumented migrants with all the vulnerability that attaches to such status or return to a Zimbabwe that, to all intents and purposes, is unchanged from the country they fled ... There are thousands of children who have been born in South Africa to ZEP holders during this time who have never even visited their parents' country of origin," HSF executive director Nicole Fritz said.           Previously, about 50 human rights organisations wrote to Motsoaledi expressing concerns over the humanitarian impact by choosing to not renew the permit used to regularise Zimbabweans living in the country.
