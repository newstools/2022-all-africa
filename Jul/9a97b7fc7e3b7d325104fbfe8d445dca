South African citrus farmers are facing tough times with the latest legislation from the European Union that requires all produce from the country to undergo extreme cold treatment of between 0°C to -1°C for at least 16 days before export, to stave off false codling moth (FCM) contamination, Eye Witness News reports.  The new rules may force the industry to ban the export of some types of citrus, including blood oranges, Turkey, Salustiana, Benny, and Midknights, which will be most affected as they cannot withstand those cold temperatures.  The government is now lodging a complaint with the World Trade Organization on the matter, IOL reports.
