Citing recent attacks on Christians in Nigeria, five Republican U.S. Senators are pressing Secretary of State Tony Blinken to return Nigeria to a watch list of governments engaging in or tolerating "particularly severe violations of religious freedom" issued annually by the State Department. The Senators - who opposed the removal of Nigeria as a 'Country of Partuclar Concern' last November - include Joss Hawley (Missouri), Marco Rubio (Florida), Mike Braun (Indiana), James Inhofe (Oklahoma) and Tom Cotton (Arkansas). The Senators cite the attack last month on St. Francis Catholic Church in Ondo state, which reportedly resulted in some 70 deaths, as well as other recent assaults against Christians.. They accuse the Nigerian government of failing to take "meanigful steps" to mitigate the violence.
