Honey bees are useful not only to humans but to other "free riders" attracted to their stored resources. The small hive beetle (Aethina tumida) is one of the species that rely on honey bee colonies to reproduce and survive. The adult beetle lays eggs on bee brood frames, full of honey and pollen. The beetle larvae then eat through these rich food sources. The consequences for the bee colony can be lethal. The beetle's larval activity causes the honey and pollen stores to start fermenting and the beetle larvae prey on the bee larvae and pupae. The Conversation team noticed something a little different about the way African honey bees interact with small hive beetles, compared with their European relatives. The African bees are more consistent and persistent in keeping the beetle in check. They chase the beetles off the main comb into areas that restrict their movement, like cracks and gaps. Worker bees then start constructing a "prison wall" out of plant resin and wax around these gaps. Other workers stand guard and keep the beetles confined. While in captivity, the beetles try to reach the comb where the honey and pollen are, but bees guarding them are constantly chasing them back and trying to grab and bite the beetles with their mandibles. The beetles were getting high-quality food while "imprisoned". We also saw that female beetles were more successful than males in getting the bees to transfer these protein-rich secretions. Females have higher nutritional requirements and drive to obtain food because they produce eggs. So the beetles, confined without access to food, learnt to trick the bees into providing the best nutrition, writes Christian W. W. Pirk for The Conversation.
