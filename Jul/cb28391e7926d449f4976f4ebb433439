Chairman of the Sovereignty Council and the Commander-in-Chief of the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) Gen Abdelfattah El Burhan, announced that the military institution will not participate anymore in the current national negotiations.           The army commander said that the Sovereignty Council will be dissolved after the formation of a new, independent government of technocrats. He stressed that the SAF will not be a vehicle for any political party to rule the country, and that it will be committed to implementing the outcomes of this dialogue.           The transitional period began in August 2019, after the Forces for Freedom and Change signed a joint agreement with the military junta to rule the country by a joint military-civilian Sovereignty Council, and would end with general elections. The same movements however supported the coup d'etat on October 25 last year, by which the military commanded by El Burhan and RSF Commander Mohamed 'Hemeti' Dagalo took over power again. The pro-democratic members of the Council of Ministers headed by PM Abdallah Hamdok resigned in November. Hamdok announced his resignation on January 2 this year.
