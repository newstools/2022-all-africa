Zambia advanced to the last four at the women's Africa Cup of Nations for the first time, after a penalty shoot-out sealed victory over Senegal on July 12, 2022.           With a place in the last four bringing an automatic berth to the 2023 World Cup hosted by Australia and New Zealand, the lack of fluency in the game could be attributed to player nerves.  Senegal who finished second in Group A behind Morocco, started the encounter with more purpose but Bruce Mwape's Zambians found their way into the game. However, they could not impose the rhythm of their short passing patterns.           No team from either country had progressed to the semi-finals since the inception of the women's Africa Cup of Nations competition in 1991. Neither country had graced the women's World Cup.           Zambia was dealt a seroius blow when football authorities announced that Barbra Banda - a top player in the team - was ineligible for the competition last week after a "gender verification procedure" that determined her testosterone levels were "too high" to for her to play.
