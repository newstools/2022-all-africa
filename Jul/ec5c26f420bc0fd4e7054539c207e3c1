Days after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavlov toured four African capitals and French President Emmanuel Macron visited three west African states, U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken announced plans to travel to three African countries after visits to Cambodia and the Phillipines next week. Blinken's intinerary includes stops in South Africa, the Democractic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. "High level visits should signal commitment, not just competition," according to Michael Gavin, writing in a blog  for the Council on Foreign Relations.
