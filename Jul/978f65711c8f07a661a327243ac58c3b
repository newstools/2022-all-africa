Nigeria's Chief Justice Tanko Muhammad has resigned in the wake of corruption allegations. President Muhammadu Buhari immediately swore in the most senior judge of the Supreme Court, Olukayode Ariwoola, as acting chief justice. Justice Muhammad leaves behind a dysfunctional justice system. Muhammad's abrupt exit comes at a time when his colleagues on the Supreme Court bench accused him of hampering the operations of the Supreme Court by failing to fund judges' welfare as well as, a lack of research assistants and inadequate accommodation, according to law expert Abiodun Odusote, who spoke to The Conversation Africa. Muhammad's predecessor, Walter Onnoghen, was controversially suspended by President Muhammadu Buhari, in January 2019, and never returned to the office until he was convicted by the Code of Conduct Tribunal for breaching the code of conduct for public officers. In February 2022, the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, blamed the Nigerian judiciary for the problem of delay in the determination of high-profile corruption cases in court.
