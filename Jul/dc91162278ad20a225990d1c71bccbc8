Birmingham is hosting this year's Commonwealth Games which kicked off on July 28 to August 8, 2022, with a spectacular opening ceremony according to Commonwealth Sports. The Games are overseen by the Commonwealth Games Federation, which controls the sporting programme and selects host cities.  Africa is well represented by 21 countries - Botswana, Cameroon, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, eSwatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Togo, Uganda, Tanzania and Zamibia.
