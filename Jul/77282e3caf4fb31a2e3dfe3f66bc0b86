The decision by the African Court on Human and People's Rights five years ago, to award reparations to Kenya's Ogiek indigenous people, for harm they suffered due to "injustices and discrimination", has been praised by an independent UN human rights expert, Francisco Cali Tzay.    The historic ruling follows a landmark judgment delivered by the Court on 26 May 2017, finding that the government had violated the right to life, property, natural resources, development, religion and culture of the Ogiek, under the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. The Court ordered the government to pay compensation of approximately U.S.$488,000, for material prejudice for loss of property and natural resources, and a further U.S.$844,000 for moral prejudice suffered by the Ogiek people, "due to violations of the right to non-discrimination, religion, culture and development", according to a statement issued by the UN human rights office, OHCHR. In addition, the court ordered non-monetary reparations, including the restitution of Ogiek ancestral lands and full recognition of the Ogiek as indigenous peoples., reports UN News.
