The National Treasury has confirmed the allocation of U.S.$30.4 million in the first phase funding in response to the April 2022 flood disaster that caused significant damage to infrastructure in various provinces. In the wake of the disaster, which largely affected the province of KwaZulu-Natal, President Cyril Ramaphosa on April 18, 2022 declared a National State of Disaster. Over 400 people died in the floods, which also damaged 4,000 homes and left about 9,000 people displaced. This comes after the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Government unveiled the land parcels that have been secured and linked to each mass care centre, as part of a programme to get the flood victims' lives back to normal. KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala said the provincial government is now in the third stage of its response, which is to focus on rehabilitation and reconstruction. This includes the construction and repair of major infrastructure, as well as the construction of houses in suitably located areas with measures to protect the residents of affected areas from such adverse weather events in the future.
