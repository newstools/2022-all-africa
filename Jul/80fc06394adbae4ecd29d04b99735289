Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of Nigeria's ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has named Kashim Shettima as his running mate. Tinubu made the announcement on Sunday July 10, 2022 while on a visit to President Muhammadu Buhari in Daura, Katsina State.           Shettima, who currently represents Borno Central in the Senate, served as governor of Borno from 2011 to 2019. Shettima was one of Tinubu's early backers and  served as the Director-General of the Tinubu Campaign Organisation.           The Premium Times reports that the prospect of a Muslim/Muslim ticket is controversial in the country. In a statement issued on the evening of Sunday July 10, Tinubu said he chose Kashim Shettima as his running mate because "I believe this is the man who can help me bring the best governance to all Nigerians, period, regardless of their religious affiliation or considerations of ethnicity or region".
