As its federal and Tigray regional governments are finally gearing up for direct negotiations for peace,  Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused a rebel group of carrying out a "new massacre" of civilians in the western Oromia state. Although State media hasn't given extensive coverage to the alleged murders, what made the headlines is a tweet from Abiy on July 4, 2022 in which he said the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) was "inflicting damage" on civilians, as its fighters fled an offensive by security forces in Oromia, writes Jerry Chifamba for allAfrica. After six months without large-scale confrontations between their respective forces, the Ethiopian government and Tigray regional leaders have both confirmed their intention to participate in efforts to bring the war to a close. On June 14, 2022 Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced plans for a peace process, while Tigray's leadership published an open letter the same day, saying it was willing to engage in talks. Two weeks later, Abiy's government named a seven-person negotiating team headed by his deputy, Demeke Mekonnen, who is from Amhara region and also serves as Ethiopia's foreign minister.             The prospect of peace talks is welcome news in a conflict that has caused probably tens of thousands of deaths and inflicted untold suffering on Tigray's population as well as civilians in neighbouring regions.           War broke out in November 2020, when a political-constitutional dispute between Tigrayan and federal leaders boiled over.
