Community led action by villagers led to the creation of a marine protected area surrounding Kuruwitu in 2005. This 30 hectare area was the first coral-based locally managed marine area in Kenya and has led to the an increase in the size and quantity of fish directly, benefiting fishers. It has also boosted biodiversity, making the area more attractive for eco-tourism. "The sea is valuable to me because it is life," says Goodluck Mbaga, an environmentalist and honorary Kenya Wildlife Service guide. It provides food, contributes to the economy, and provides income and recreation. There's a need for all of us to learn how to conserve the ocean as we are yet to harness its full potential".
