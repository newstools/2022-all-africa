In 2016, Catherine Nakayemba and her two friends - Atuhurra Angella Marjorie and Ndagire Corret - decided to start Safe Girl Reusable Pads, a small business with a vision to create reusable sanitary pads for women and girls. Safe Girl is based in a rural village in Mpigi District and currently employs 11 young mothers to make the pads for rural communities. Reusable sanitary towels can be used for up to two years, making them ideal for people living in rural areas with no toilets, electricity or running water. They are also inexpensive and environmental friendly. This is good news when it come to the climate crisis and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the UN's Environment Programme - Single-use menstrual products and their alternatives, Recommendations from Life Cycle Assessments - single-use menstrual products such as tampons and pads are a significant contributor globally to single-use plastic waste.
