Police in South Africa are investigating two bar shootings, one in a township close to Johannesburg and another in the country's east at the weekend. At least 19 people were killed and dozens injured. In Soweto, 15 people were killed after as they enjoyed a night out, police said, when assailants drew up in a minibus taxi and began randomly firing at bar patrons. In the eastern city of Pietermaritzburg, police reported four people were killed and eight wounded during a shootout in a bar after two men fired discriminately at customers. Police sources said it was too early to say if the assaults were in some way connected but observed their similarity.
