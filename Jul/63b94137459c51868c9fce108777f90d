Marburg Virus Disease is a highly infectious viral hemorrhagic fever in the same family as the Ebola virus disease. The symptoms of Marburg include diarrhea, fever, nausea and vomiting.           The Ghana Health Service (GHS) has confirmed the Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) following the testing of two cases recorded in the country, at the Institute of Pasteur in Dakar, (IPD), Senegal.           The GHS, in a statement issued and signed by the Director-General, Dr Patrick Kuma-Aboagye, said 98 contacts that were identified after the two cases were recorded in the Ashanti Region were currently under quarantine and are being monitored by the Ashanti and Savannah Regional Health Directorates of the GHS.           Marburg Virus Disease (MVD), the GHS said, could be spread from infected animals such as bats on direct contacts with blood or body fluids including faeces of bats.           It has cautioned the general public to thoroughly cook all animal products -blood and meat - before consumption and if symptoms are displayed, to quickly report to the nearest health facility for medical attention as there is no vaccination for it.
