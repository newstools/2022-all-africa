The government has announced that it would approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout and the IMF's Country Representative, Dr Albert Touna-Mama, has confirmed receipt of the request to support the country's economic programme.           Meanwhile, Arise Ghana protestors embarked on the second day of the 'Krom Ay3shi' demonstration to express their grievances about the harsh economic situation, in the country in Accra Yesterday. Protesters wearing red and black, held placards with inscriptions such as "Songhor salt stolen forever; Russia-Ukraine war has nothing to do with the hikes, reduce fuel prices now!; We won't allow you to rob our future with this Agyapa deal; Job opportunities for all-scam; Repeal the obnoxious E-levy Act now."           Among the demands of the demonstrators as listed in the petition, were calls for the immediate withdrawal of the E-Levy Act, the scrapping of the Borla tax and the numerous taxes on fuel.  The E-Levy Act was passed by the government to impose a levy of 1.50% on electronic transfers at the time of transfer. This initiative was implemented to broaden the tax base in the country and generate revenue.
