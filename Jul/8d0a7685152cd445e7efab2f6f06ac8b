At least 65 people have died and 150 others were wounded in the intercommunal clashes that began a week ago in Sudan's Blue Nile state. Authorities were deployed in the state's towns of Ed Damazin and El Roseires, in an effort to impose a curfew and quell the violence between the opposing Hausa and Birta ethnic groups.           Sudan has seen mass protests and a violent clampdown by authorities since the military removed a transitional government in October 2021.           Until the coup, the country was moving toward democracy following the overthrowal of autocratic former president Omar al-Bashir in 2019. Experts say the putsch created a security vacuum that has sparked a resurgence in ethnic violence over land, livestock, and access to water and grazing areas.           In April 2022, clashes killed more than 200 people in war-ravaged Darfur.
