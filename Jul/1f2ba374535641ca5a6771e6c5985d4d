The International Criminal Court (ICC) on July 1 marked 20 years with few victories and many questions about its legitimacy. The fundamental question remains whether it can successfully prosecute the perpetrators of the biggest war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, reports Ian Katusiime for The Independent. The ICC has faced accusations of racism and bias from African leaders; a number of whom have been indicted by the court, and now the court's watchers are keen to see if the court will take any action on Russian atrocities in the war on Ukraine. Human rights organization Amnesty International has warned that the court's legitimacy risks being eroded by an increasingly selective approach to justice. The organization highlighted several recent decisions and practices which appear to demonstrate double standards and a willingness to be influenced by powerful states.
