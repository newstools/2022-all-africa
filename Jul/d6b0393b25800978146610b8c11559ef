Radio France Internationale has received a report suggesting that the government-funded French Development Agency is preparing to take over funding of the Democratic Republic of Congo's Kahuzi-Biega Park from Germany. Attacks on the Batwa people living in the park - including murder, rape and immolation - occurred between 2019 and 2021 and was recently documented in a report by the NGO, Minority International. It is alleged that guards and DR Congo soldiers carried out the attacks to force the Batwa off their ancestral land.           The park is a haven for endangered gorillas and one of the DR Congo's biggest tourist attractions. It receives most of its funding from the German government in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a federal agency, and the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society.
