The Trans-Niger Pipeline, a major pipeline capable of transporting about 180,000 barrels of crude per day, has been dry since mid-June, 2022 due to theft. According to Bloomberg, despite this development, the pipeline has not been formally shut. The pipeline capacity is about 15% of Nigeria's most recent average daily output. Crude oil theft had taken a worrisome dimension in Nigeria with losses from pipeline vandalisation becoming even more overwhelming. Youths striving to make a living in Nigeria's oil-rich Niger Delta region, have steadily sabotaged the government's output through their illegal refining activities and stealing of crude from pipelines. Group Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited - formerly the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation - disclosed in April 2022 that the country had lost U.S.$4 billion to oil theft at the rate of 200,000 barrels per day in 2021. The government said it had collaborated with security agencies, operators, and relevant stakeholders, to clamp down on the activities of oil thieves, and illegal refining.
