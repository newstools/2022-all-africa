Kenya's National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) gave Facebook a seven-day ultimatum to enforce hate speech prevention guidelines or face suspicion in the country. The action came after advocacy group Global Witness issued a report calling for a suspension of Facebook advertising until the election on August 9 is concluded. The group said Facebook should take a series of actions similar to the "Break the Glass" measures Facebook immediately following the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol. "Facebook can and should urgently take similar actions in Kenya. If Mark Zuckerberg chooses to sit on his hands, it will make it clear that for him, and for Facebook, American lives matter - Kenyan lives don't," said Cori Crider, director of Foxglove, the UK-based NGO that joined Global Witness in issuing the report, along with "Facebook Files" whistleblower Frances Haugen. The report says 20 ads in English and Swahili containing hate speech submitted to Facebook were approved for publication. After Facebook was notified of the findings, the social media platform's owner Meta issued a statement outlining steps "to help  ensure a safe and secure general election. Researchers then submitted two more ads "to see if there had indeed been any improvement in Facebook's detection of hate speech ads," and both were approved.
