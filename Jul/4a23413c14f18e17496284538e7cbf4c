Students find it difficult to secure jobs after their graduation, as most of them graduate with little or no awareness of the job market or the skills required. To fill these gaps, Dereja provides employability skills training to young people that helps prepare them for the world of work. Dereja, in partnership with the Ministry of Labor and Skills (MOLS) and the Mastercard Foundation, is hosting a series of career expos in five public universities to connect recent graduates with employers across the country. The expos are being hosted at Addis Ababa, Haromaya, Hawassa, Jimma, and Bahir Dar Universities between June and August 2022. Find out more.  Find out more about Mastercard Foundation in Africa.
