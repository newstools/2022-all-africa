The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency has said that they have now recovered at least 15 bodies after a passenger boat capsized in the Ikorodu area of Lagos State. The inland waterways authority said the boat had set sail on July 8, 2022 -  later than the rules permitted and that the tide carried the vessel towards a barge, causing it to overturn. The accident comes barely three days after another passenger boat capsized in the same waters, with two people reported to have drowned. The capsizing of boats are common on Nigerian waterways and are mostly due to overloading and a lack of maintenance. The government has promised to enforce safety measures and prosecute boat operators who are using substandard vessels.
