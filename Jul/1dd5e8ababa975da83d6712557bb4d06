In April 2018, Leadership reported that the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) decried the spread of Severe Acute Malnutrition in the northeast zone of Nigeria. At the time it warned that 88,000 children were at risk of death in the region if untreated. Rising conflict between Boko Haram militants and government forces, has worsened in the northeast for a number of years and Voice of America and Medicins Sans Frontieres report that the neglected situation of malnutrition has reached critical proportions in that region of Nigeria, with tens of thousands of children at risk.
