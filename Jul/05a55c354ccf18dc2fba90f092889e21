Federal security forces in Addis Ababa have rearrested Kibrom Berhe, head of foreign affairs of the National Congress of Great Tigray's Baytona Party - an opposition political party from Tigray regional state. He was arrested days after parliament passed a resolution to investigate war atrocities. Kibrom's Baytona Party is seeking a confederation arrangement with independent states. Its political ideologies advocate that the concept of a united Ethiopia is impossible, given its history and structure. This is the second arrest for Kibrom - he was one of thousands of Tigrayans detained in July 2021 - in what Amnesty International described as "arbitrary arrests targeting Tigrayans". Kibrom was released without charge after months of detention in Afar state, and has since written a book on the civil war in Tigray.
