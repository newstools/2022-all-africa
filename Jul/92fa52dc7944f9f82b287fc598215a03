Agriculture Cabinet Secretary, Peter Munya, has urged Kenyans to diversify their daily meal menus by eating other types of foods in the wake of soaring prices of maize flour, the main ingredient of ugali, Kenya's staple food. The government suspended the levies imposed on imported maize, a move which millers claimed would have an insignificant effect as it would only reduce the price of two kilogram maize flour by Sh2. This elicited reactions from Kenyans who are struggling to meet their basic needs amid the weakening of the Kenyan shilling against the U.S. dollar. In response to this, Munya insists that the suspension of levies is a well-calculated move by the government aimed at lowering the prices of maize meals to manageable levels. Munya has said that while maize is the staple food, Kenyans should opt for other types of foods whenever there is a shortage of maize flour in the country. He further urged Kenyans to embrace planting different types of foods so that they can feed themselves without depending on imported foods.
