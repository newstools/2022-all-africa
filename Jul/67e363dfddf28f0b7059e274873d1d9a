Insurgents have destroyed 31 of the 130 health units that existed in the northern Mozambican province of Cabo Delgado, according to Health Minister Armindo Tiago. The onslaught has left the residents of Mocímboa da Praia, Quissanga, Macomia and Meluco districts without access to basic health care.  Meanwhile, a further 95 health units had been destroyed by the extreme climatic events that struck Mozambique in recent years, notably Cyclones Ana, Dumako and Gombe, which all hit the country this year. Since the start of 2022, the country has been battered by five tropical storms and cyclones along its northern coastal areas. These have affected thousands of families, including refugees and people internally displaced by ongoing violence in the northern province of Cabo Delgado - illustrating once again how the effects of climate change interact with many of the root causes of displacement, resulting in malnutrition.
