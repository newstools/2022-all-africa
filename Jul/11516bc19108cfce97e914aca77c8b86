As the water crisis intensifies in Nelson Mandela Bay in the province of the Eastern Cape, people queued for hours to fill containers from Jojo tanks filled by municipal tankers, writes Mkhuseli Sizani for GroundUp. Dam levels are at 14.7% of combined capacity, but the accessible ("usable") water that can be transferred to treatment plants and reservoirs in Nelson Mandela Bay is currently at 2.3% of dam capacity. This changes slightly according to how the barges extracting the water are moved. The municipality says it is very concerned about high water usage on weekends. Over the last several years, major cities such as Cape Town, Sao Paulo and Barcelona have faced 'Day Zero' scenarios, characterised by the very real possibility of running out of water. As the world continues its urbanising trend, there are important lessons to be learned from these water crises: Why do they happen, what was the impact and the response? These lessons will be central to tackling future urban water-related risks and vulnerabilities especially given the uncertainties created by increased climate change and variability.
