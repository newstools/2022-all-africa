Developed countries who have grown their economies through large-scale fossil fuel use and exploitative extraction of other resources bear most of the responsibility for the climate crisis. But many of these countries still refuse to take responsibility for the loss and damage that people in the global South are experiencing now. At recent climate meetings in Bonn, Germany the United States and European Union opposed putting financing for loss and damage on the agenda for the climate talks to be held in Egypt later this year. "This refusal continues long histories of European racism, including the deeply racialised processes of large-scale extraction that fuelled and sustained the Industrial Revolution from the outset", writes Erin Fitz-Henry for The Conversation Africa.
