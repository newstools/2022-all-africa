Amnesty International is calling for an investigation into the massacre of more than 400 Amhara civilians in Ethiopia's Oromia region in June 2022, citing eyewitnesses who blamed a local rebel group for the killings.           The Amnesty statement follows a call by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet last month, urging the Ethiopian authorities to conduct "prompt, impartial and thorough" investigations into the Tole killings.           No official death toll from the massacre has been published, but Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's office said in June 2022 that 338 victims were identified.           The Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) has denied the accusations, saying government-allied militias were responsible for the massacre in the west of Ethiopia's most populous region, which has seen an increase in violence in recent months.
