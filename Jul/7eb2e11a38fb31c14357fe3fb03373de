Kenya has four presidential candidates in the August 2022 general election. They recently launched their manifestos and one thing that ties them together, is the economy. In no other Kenyan election has the economy been such a key subject, not just for those seeking power, but for voters, too. There are two reasons - a maturing democracy and recent developments that are affecting Kenyans' pockets. As a country develops, economic issues take centre stage. Kenya's political leaders are shifting the campaign focus from personalities and ethnicity to economic well-being and growth, writes  Xn Iraki for The Conversation. The candidates have made numerous promises. These include stipends to poor families, access to cheaper credit, land reforms, a clampdown on unorthodox exports, access to farm subsidies and other interventions. But realistically, the country's economic challenges will be difficult to overcome and there's only so much that a government can do about them. Meanwhile in other election developments, Capital FM reports that Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru said that National Rainbow Coalition-Kenya (Narc) Kenya leader Martha Karua went against the will of the people in supporting Azimio La Umoja-One Kenya Presidential candidate, Raila Odinga. The Kenya National Civil Society Centre has applauded the Supreme Court decision sustaining the impeachment of former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko saying, in so doing, the court upheld the spirit of Chapter Six of the Constitution. Deputy President William Ruto has promised to put up a "bigger chapel" at State House as a matter of priority, if elected president on August 9, 2022.
