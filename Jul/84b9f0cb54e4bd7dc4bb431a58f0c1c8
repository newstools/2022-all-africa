Angela Okutoyi made history by becoming the first Kenyan to win a Grand Slam title when she teamed up with Dutch Rose Nijkamp to clinch the Wimbledon Junior Tennis doubles title on July 9, 2022. In a tough final, Okutoyi and Nijkamp lost the opening set but battled hard in the second, to send the match into a tie-break which they won in brilliant fashion. Meanwhile, after Tunisian Ons Jabeur's historic run to the Wimbledon final, in which she became the first African woman and first Arab player to reach a Grand Slam final in the Open Era, she says she was really disappointed to lose in her first Grand Slam final but she's a positive person who always tries to look on the bright side - so that will help her to get over losing at Wimbledon. Both Okutoyi and Jabeur have garnered tremendous attention back home in Kenya and Tunisia, and across the African continent.
