The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy has opened the Bidders Conference for renewable energy producers and stakeholders following government's call for bids under the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP). The REIPPPP is aimed at urgently addressing the country's energy needs and deficit by adding more megawatts to the grid through renewable energy sources. The department launched the request for proposals for the sixth bid window in April, 2022 and says the conference is an opportunity for stakeholders to clarify issues or needs with the department. This comes after President Cyril Ramaphosa said the Just Energy Transition (JET) Framework will serve as a key evidence-based guide for policy making for the country's transition from a carbon intensive economy towards a greener and cleaner economy. A just transition is defined by a nation's adoption of a low-carbon economy. It is based on social dialogue between workers and their unions, employers, government and communities, according to the Life After Coal campaign. "As this Just Transition framework underscores, combating climate change is not only an environmental imperative, but an economic one as well. This framework is an evidence-based document and a victory for evidence-based policymaking. "The publication of this framework must now serve as a call to action to each of us to embrace the opportunities presented by a low-carbon, inclusive, climate resilient economy and society," Ramaphosa said. The nation currently faces a strained energy supply with scheduled power cuts implemented by national power utility Eskom who most recently experienced strike action by its workers.
