The government has said that it will penalise the BBC over a documentary made by its investigations programme Africa Eye about the bandit warlords of Zamfara state. The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said the government is aware of the "unprofessional documentary" by the BBC Africa Eye, where interviews were granted to bandit warlords and terror gangs. The minister also condemned Trust TV, owned by Media Trust Ltd, for using its platform to grant an interview to a bandit, Shehu Rekeb, thereby promoting the activities of terrorists. Mohammad said the penalties against BBC will be set by the country's National Broadcasting Commission, although the body does not regulate international media houses. The documentary came out at a time when there are rising levels of insecurity in the country, especially in the north, where the militant groups operate. In June 2022, the Zamfara governor Bello Muhammad Matawalle, asked residents to arm themselves against the militants and announced a shoot-to-kill order on anyone found using a motorcycle.
