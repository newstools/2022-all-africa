Banyana Banyana's victory at the Women's Africa Cup of Nation (WAFCON) brought into sharp focus the gender disparities that still exist in South Africa, even though the country's Constitution guarantees that no person should be discriminated against based on their sex or gender. So what could be the problem, really?           This is not the first time there has been public debate around equal pay, yet change has been happening at a snail's pace if there has been any at all. It's been reported that the South African women's football squad experienced severe underpayment and occasionally no payment at all, a problem attributed to unfair gender norms.           When South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa met the African champions at the Union Buildings in Pretoria he said there was need to give added remuneration to young women that have made South Africa proud.           Many women athletes still earn considerably less than they should and what Banyana has achieved may not simply be a win for the team, but for all sportwomen on the continent.
