After a four year hiatus, the Women's Africa Cup of Nations, WAFCON, kicked off on July 2 and will run until July 23, 2022 in Morocco. WAFCON is arguably the biggest women's sports event in Africa and has been extended to include 12 teams. Hosts Morocco, Cameroon, Nigeria (who won the tournament the most times), South Africa, Tunisia, Senegal, Zambia, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Togo, Uganda and Burundi are all jostling for the big prize but as in all sport, there can only be one winner. This year's tournament will also decide Africa's four Women's World Cup 2023 qualifiers. Thus far, there has been several nailbiters, including the kickoff match between Cameroon and Zamibia that saw a goalless draw. Nigeria's Super Falcons went down to South Africa's Banyana Banyana on July 4, 2022. Banyana Banyana kept their 100% track record in the group stages with a win over Botswana 1-0 on July 10, 2022 at Morocco's Complexe Sportif Prince Moulay Abdellah. The South Africans are now on top of Group C log and are through to the quarterfinals against Tunisia. Nigeria walloped Burundi 4-0 on July 10, 2022 to also progress to the quarterfinals. While Nigeria is still the team to beat, Cameroon and South Africa are favourites too.
