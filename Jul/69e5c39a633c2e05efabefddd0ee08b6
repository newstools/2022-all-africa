Liberia has marked 175 years of independence. Africa's oldest republic, is far from where it ought to be. The country with different ethnic groups went through brutal civil war for over over a decade. The end of the civil war in 2003 was widely seen as an opportunity for the country to restructure governance and ensure equity in its distribution of resources, writes Front Page Africa.           Growing corruption has contributed to the government's failure to effectively tackle some of its most critical problems, including the fixing of critical infrastructure. According to Transaprency International's Corruption Perception Index for 2021, Liberia ranks 136th out of 180 countries.           It is a paradox that a country with abundant human and material resources, where nationals are breaking barriers across the world, a country that has produced Nobel Laureates would at the same time be the world capital of poverty, writes Front Page Africa.
