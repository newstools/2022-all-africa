Voice of America's Lisa Schlein writes that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is warning that hundreds of millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa are going hungry due to conflict, climate shocks, and rising food prices triggered by Russia's invasion of the Ukraine. The ICRC warns that Africa's food crisis is set to worsen. It says conflict and armed violence, failing harvests due to years of drought, and increases in food and other commodity prices are driving more people into extreme poverty and hunger.
