Opinion poll firms in the country have until August 4, 2022 to release their last findings on electoral seats being contested in the August general election. This is to ensure they comply with the Publication of Electoral Opinion Polls Act which was signed into law by late president Mwai Kibaki in 2012, after parliament passed a Private Member Bill that was initiated by former Ikolomani MP Bonny Khalwale. Clause 7 (1) of the Act states that a person shall not publish the results of any electoral opinion poll on the day of the election or during the period of five days immediately preceding the date of an election. Those found guilty of contravening the clause under the Act would be liable to pay a fine not exceeding one million shillings, or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year, or both. Leading opinion polls companies such as Infotrak Research and Consulting and Trends and Insights For Africa are expected to hold briefings with the media to release their respective reports, Laban Wanambisi reports for Capital FM.
