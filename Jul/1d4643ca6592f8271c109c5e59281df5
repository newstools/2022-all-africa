The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda agreed to a "de-escalation process" to curb the fighting and violence along their shared eastern border on July 6, 2022. The agreement included a withdrawal of M23 fighters from DR Congo.           Clashes broke out in Eastern Congo on July 7, 2022 between the military and M23, after the rebel group said that the ceasefire deal signed the previous day was "irrelevant."           "We are Congolese, not Rwandan," M23 spokesperson Willy Ngoma said. "If there's a ceasefire, it can only be between us and the DR Congo government."           Ngoma said the latest clashes broke out after M23 positions around Kanyabusoro in Rwanda, were attacked. Residents in the area were forced to flee their homes.
