Secretary of state Anthony Blnken will begin a three-nation trip to Africa on August 7 in South Africa, where he will deliver a major policy speech enunciating the administration's Africa strategy. A new policy framework has been under discussion for many months and will serve as the major backdrop for the mid-December African Leaders Summit President Biden will host in Washington, DC. Blinken's tour, which also includes stops in the Democractic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, closely follows last week's four-nation visit by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavlov and French President Emmanuel Macron's travel to three west African states. The Secretary will be accompanied by Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Mollie Phee, Enoh T. Ebong, who directs the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, and Dr. John Nkengasong, the former head of the African CDC who is the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator leading the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Dr. Reuben Brigety II, President Biden's choice to be ambassador to South Africa who was confirmed by the Senate on July 21, is expected to be at his new post to welcome the Secretary to the country.
