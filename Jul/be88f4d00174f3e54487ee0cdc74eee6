UNAIDS has warned that progress in prevention and treatment has faltered worldwide, putting millions of lives at risk. Globally, the number of new infections dropped by only 3.6% between 2020 and 2021, the smallest annual decline in new HIV infections since 2016.  "In Danger", the name of the latest report by the Joint UN Programme on HIV and Aids, coincides with the International Aids Conference that began on July 27 to July 28, 2022 in Montreal. It shows how new HIV infections are now rising where they had been falling, in places such as Asia and the Pacific, the world's most populous region. In East and Southern Africa, rapid progress from previous years slowed significantly in 2021. Despite effective HIV treatment and tools to prevent and detect infection, the pandemic has thrived during Covid-19, in mass displacement settings, and other global crises that have put a strain on resources and reshaped development financing decisions, to the detriment of HIV programmes, reports UNAIDS.
