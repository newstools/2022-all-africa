In Er-rich, nestled in the Atlas Mountains, women and men settle into a packed room as an FAO beekeeping training gets underway. Their whispers and laughter blend together in an undercurrent of anticipation. But their purpose is serious: to do whatever they can to ensure the very survival of a species. Throughout the day, the beekeepers of all ages will learn about the Saharan yellow bee, a species that is hardy, non-aggressive and well-adapted to local climatic and breeding conditions.
