An opinion poll by Intel Research has put the popularity rating of Deputy President William Ruto ahead of his close competitor Raila Odinga at 49.9%. According to the poll, Odinga has a rating of 42.5%, with 3.7% of those polled undecided. Intel Research in their study showed that Ruto is likely to manage a round one win against his competitors, stating that a runoff is not a possibility with less than a month to the general elections. Ruto has come out to say some of his opponents are his biggest supporters but they can't come out publicly for fear of persecution. He disclosed that he continues to receive calls at night from some of his perceived opponents from Odinga's Azimio La Umoja-One Kenya Alliance, who back his candidature. Odinga's running mate Martha Karua has termed Ruto a man totally unfit for leadership. While on a tour in Nyeri County, Karua elaborated that Ruto's show of disrespect to his boss President Uhuru Kenyatta is a clear sign he is not suited for the top seat in government.
