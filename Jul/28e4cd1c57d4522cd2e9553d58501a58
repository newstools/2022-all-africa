Botswana is hosting an international meeting aimed at strengthening democracy and adherence to constitutions in Africa. Participants are calling on African militaries and leaders to respect term limits after several recent coups and efforts to extend time in power. The three-day summit, organised by Botswana and the U.S.-based National Democratic Institute (NDI), has attracted former heads of state and civil society activists from across Africa.           Peaceful political transitions remain elusive in some African countries. In the last 16 months alone, leaders have been ousted by coups in Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso and Sudan.           The Gaborone meeting is a follow-up to a 2019 summit held in Niger, to promote the respect of constitutional limits. Niger's former president, Mahamadou Issoufou, speaking via videolink, said there is concern over the state of democracy in Africa. "We have some results from certain countries, but democracy is regressing in certain countries, and especially through military coups. I am happy Botswana and Niger are speaking with one voice. Countries have to respect the two-term limit", he said.
