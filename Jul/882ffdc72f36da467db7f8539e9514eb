At least 600 inmates escaped in a jailbreak in Abuja, Nigeria's capital city, officials said blaming the attack on Boko Haram insurgents. About 300 inmates had been recaptured, authorities said.  According to Reuters, Shuaib Belgore, permanent secretary of Nigeria's Ministry of Interior, has said that the "very determined" rebels attacked the Kuje medium-security prison in Abuja with "very high-grade explosives," killing one guard. The prison was holding a number of high-profile detainees, including suspected militants and jailed politicians. This is the latest in a series of jailbreaks in Nigeria in which more than 5,000 inmates have escaped since 2020. At least five prisons have been attacked in the last 18 months across Nigeria. They are those of Jos, Oyo, Kabba, and Owerri.
