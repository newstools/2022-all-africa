Timothy Olobulu reports for Capital FM that Kenya lost its bid to host the 2025 World Athletics Championships, when world athletics chief Sebastian Coe announced that Tokyo, host of the 2021 Olympic games, won the hosting rights for the athletics showpiece. The Polish city of Silesia, as well as Singapore, placed bids to host the 2025 editions, but, the Japanese capital which hosted last year's Olympic Games came out tops. Kenya was confident of winning the bid  after successfully hosting the World Under-18 Championships in 2017 and the World Under-20 Championships in 2021. It also hosted the three editions of the Kip Keino Classic - a leg of the World Athletics Continental Gold Tour. Had Kenya won, it would have been the first time that Africa would have hosted the prestigous 10-day event.  Kenya will now consider whether it would submit a bid for the 2027 showpiece.
