Human rights watchdogs have called for the immediate and unconditional release of eSwatini members of parliament Mduduzi Bacede Mabuza and Mthandeni Dube. The two were detained on July 25, 2021 following protests demanding political reforms and were charged under the Suppression of Terrorism Act and for flouting Covid-19 regulations.           Pro-democracy protests started in June 2021 in the Kingdom of eSwatini following the mysterious death of 25-year-old law student, Thabani Nkomonye who allegedly died at the hands of the police. Over 1,000 people were arrested and the security forces were called in to stamp out dissent. The human rights landscape in Africa's last remaining absolute monarchy remains characterised by serious human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and repression of pro-democracy activists.
