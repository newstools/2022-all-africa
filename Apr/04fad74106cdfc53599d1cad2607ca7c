Ethiopia's maternal mortality rate currently stands at 401 for every 100,000 live births, a reduction from 676 for every 100,000 live births in 2011. The decline in the maternal mortality rate can be attributed to the innovative programmes designed to expand and accelerate midwifery training to achieve a minimum standard of midwife to population ratio and increase skilled birth attendance and reproductive health services, especially in rural areas. The programmes are also narrowing the gap in health service delivery and strengthening the midwifery profession in Ethiopia, writes Metasebia Dereje and Beti Baiye for Nigeria Health Watch. Although the country still has a long way to go, the expansion of midwifery training programmes and the quality of training received, as well as the growing number of midwives throughout Ethiopia has greatly contributed to a decrease in the country's maternal mortality and infant mortality rates. According to the Ministry of Health, more than 20,000 midwives have been deployed to health centres across the country.
