The death toll of Lassa fever has risen to 132 since the beginning of 2022, amid ongoing measures by the government to reduce infections across the country. Minister of State for Health, Olorunnimbe Mamora said that the country has so far recorded 691 confirmed cases, out of a total of 3,746 suspected cases across 23 of Nigeria's 36 states. Lassa fever is an acute and often viral hemorrhagic fever, transmitted to human beings via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Symptoms include fever, general weakness, vomiting and diarrhoea, headaches, and coughing. In January 2022, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, said it had activated the national multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary Lassa fever emergency operations centre in response to the outbreak in the country. The disease control agency said it is currently distributing medical response commodities to states and treatment centres, as part of measures to control the spread of the disease.
