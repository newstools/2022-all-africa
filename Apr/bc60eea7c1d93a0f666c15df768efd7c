According to a study, a new short-course treatment is effective against HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis with fewer serious side effects, and has the potential to reduce the length and cost of hospital admissions, SciDev reports.           According to estimates produced by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, cryptococcal meningitis, a fungal infection which invades the lining of the brain, kills over 180,00 every year globally, with 75% of deaths occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa.           Joseph Jarvis, lead author and a research associate at the Botswana Harvard AIDS Partnership Institute, says that cryptococcal meningitis is a severe disease in people with HIV, and is the most common cause of meningitis in adults, especially in East and Southern Africa. It causes about 15% of all deaths related to HIV globally.
