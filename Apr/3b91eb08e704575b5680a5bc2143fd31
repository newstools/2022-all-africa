The armed bandits who captured train passengers in Kaduna in March 2022 after an explosion, have released their photographs, two weeks after a video of them went viral on social media. The bandits threatened to kill the hostages if the Nigerian government did not meet their demands.  Relatives of the hostages have appealed to the government to do everything possible to ensure the release of their loved ones. President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered security agencies to ensure the rescue of all those who were captured. Armed criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, are blamed for rising violence and mass kidnappings in the northwest of Nigeria.
