The South African Medical Association (SAMA) has said there is a need for intensive campaigning for more people to vaccinate against Covid-19, despite the lifting of the National State of Disaster (NSD). SAMA welcomed the lifting of the National State of Disaster by President Cyril Ramaphosa, describing it as a positive step for South Africa and the correct move forward for the country's beleaguered economy. "Considering the decreasing number of Covid-19 cases in the country, ending the National State of Disaster is the appropriate step in government's response to the pandemic. "SAMA supports the decision in the same way that it supported the decision to institute the NSD as a means to deal with the impact of Covid-19 at the beginning of the pandemic," SAMA CEO, Dr Vusumuzi Nhlapho, said in a statement. Cabinet decided to end the National State of Disaster with effect from midnight on Monday, April 5, 2022, with the exception of a few transitional regulations remaining in place. "Since the requirements for a National State of Disaster to be declared in terms of the Disaster Management Act are no longer met, Cabinet has decided to terminate the National State of Disaster with effect from midnight tonight," President Cyril Ramaphosa announced in an address to the nation. As of April 6, 2022, South Africa has confirmed a total of 3,725,177 cases of Colvid-19 of which 100,067 proved fatal and 3,613,688 resulted in recovery. Vaccinations administered to date amount to 20,987,044.
