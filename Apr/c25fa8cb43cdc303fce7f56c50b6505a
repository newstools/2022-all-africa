The conditions of nearly 90% of the International Monetary Fund's pandemic-related loans are forcing developing nations suffering some of the world's worst humanitarian crises to implement austerity measures that fuel further impoverishment and inequality, an analysis published Tuesday by Oxfam International shows. Commons Dreams reports that Oxfam found that "13 out of the 15 IMF loan programs negotiated during the second year of the pandemic require new austerity measures such as taxes on food and fuel or spending cuts that could put vital public services at risk." Nabil Abdo, Oxfam International's Senior Policy Advisor, said: "This epitomizes the IMF's double standard: it is warning rich countries against austerity while forcing poorer ones into it." Examples of the loans include a U.S.$2.3 billion agreement between Kenya and the IMF which includes a three-year public sector pay freeze and increased taxes on cooking gas and food. Nine countries including Cameroon and Senegal are required to introduce or increase the collection of value-added taxes, which often apply to everyday products like food and clothing, and fall disproportionately on people living in poverty. And Sudan, where nearly half of the population is living in poverty, has been required to scrap fuel subsidies which will hit the poorest hardest.
