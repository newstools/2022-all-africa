As the Covid-19 pandemic enters its third year, a group of mayors from the African continent have committed to improve city governance for health and wellbeing as well as to promote measures for sustainable livelihoods. The African Mayors Dialogue on Urban Governance for Health and Wellbeing, an event organized jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa and the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT), with the support of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) took place on March 30, 2022 at the UN Hub of the Expo Dubai. The event was attended by mayors from five major African cities - Brazzaville, Douala, Freetown, Gaborone and Lusaka. The mayors shared their strategies for strengthening local leadership around public health and wellbeing, particularly in the light of the social disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The dialogue afforded mayors and local leaders a platform for exchanging ideas and presenting their cities' experiences on urban governance for health and wellbeing, reports WHO.
