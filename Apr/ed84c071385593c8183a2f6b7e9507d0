Militants in Mali say they have captured at least one Russian mercenary from the Wagner Group, a private military company with alleged links to Russian President Vladimir Putin.           Several countries have accused Mali's military government of working with forces from the Wagner Group, a shadowy private company that has provided Russian mercenaries to several countries, including Libya, Syria and the Central African Republic. The Mali government denies any links with the Wagner Group, saying it only works with official "Russian trainers."           On April 23, 2022 the French army released drone surveillance video footage, showing mercenaries allegedly burying bodies in the sand near Gossi, Mali, where the French army withdrew last week. The army claims it is an attempted smear campaign to later accuse them of leaving mass graves.           Similar video circulated on Twitter two days earlier , accusing French forces of killing the people seen in the video.
