Over 97 million children in Africa are out of school, and 52 million are girls. This number continues to grow with the rising demand for education, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The Graça Machel Trust has partnered with a number of organisations to conduct Back2School research, which has been funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC). In addition, it supports the Global Partnership for Education Knowledge and Innovation Exchange, to generate evidence supporting scaling up accelerated learning models for out of school children to facilitate the reintegration of out-of-school rural girls in Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia. These three countries have been identified among the many countries in Africa with disproportionately high levels of out of school children, mainly rural girls.
