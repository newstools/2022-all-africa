Mali's army reported on April 1, 2022 that it had killed 203 militants in an operation in the centre of the Sahel state, an apparent surge in violence in the conflict-torn country.           The army said the March 23-31, 2022 military operation took place in Sahel's Moura area, which it termed a "terrorist fiefdom." The UN peacekeeping mission in the country however says it has heard reports of civilian deaths, raising human rights concerns.           The French foreign ministry, in a statement on April 4, 2022 said: "France is deeply concerned by information of mass abuses in the village of Moura by elements of the Mali armed forces accompanied by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group, which are said to have caused the death of hundreds of civilians."           The EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the reports of a massacre and abuses in the Moura village is worrying. He urged Mali to allow investigators to access the region, adding that "the fight against terrorism can in no way justify massive human rights violations".           France announced in February 2022 that it was withdrawing its troops from Mali after a breakdown in relations with the country's ruling junta, ending a near 10-year deployment.
