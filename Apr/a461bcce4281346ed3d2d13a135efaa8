Cote d'Ivoire President Alassane Ouattara announced on April 13, 2022 that the country's prime minister, Patrick Achi, has resigned. Ouattara made the announcement at the opening of Achi's last Cabinet meeting.           Achi became prime minister in April 2021, as the West African nation was in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. He was appointed as the head of government after his predecessor Hamed Bakayoko died of cancer. Bakayoko also became prime minister after Amadou Gon Coulibaly died suddenly in July 2020.           Achi has not yet commented on his resignation, but in his last Cabinet meeting, he said that his decision followed the intentions of the president to re-shuffle the government.           President Ouattara has said that he will appoint a new prime minister - "who will come to me to propose a streamlined government" - by next week.
