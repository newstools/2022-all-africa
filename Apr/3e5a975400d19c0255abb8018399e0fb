Cabinet has decided to end the National State of Disaster with effect from midnight on Monday, April 5, 2022, with the exception of a few transitional regulations remaining in place. "Since the requirements for a National State of Disaster to be declared in terms of the Disaster Management Act are no longer met, Cabinet has decided to terminate the National State of Disaster with effect from midnight tonight," President Cyril Ramaphosa announced in an address to the nation. The President said following shall apply: Individuals will still be required to wear a facemask in an indoor public space, however, a mask is not required when outdoors. Existing restrictions on gatherings will continue as a transitional measure. This means that both indoor and outdoor venues can take up to 50% of their capacity without any maximum limit, provided that proof of vaccination or a Covid-19 test not older than 72 hours is required for entrance to the venue. Where there is no provision for proof of vaccination or a Covid-19 test, then the current upper limit of 1000 people indoors and 2000 people outdoors will remain. Meanwhile, the directions that provide for the payment of the special R350 Social Relief of Distress grant will remain in place. This will enable the Department of Social Development to finalise the regulations that will allow the payment of the grant to continue. The end of the National State of Disaster comes 750 days since the country went into its initial lockdown on 15 March 2020 to curb the spread of Covid-19. As of April 5, 2022, South Africa has confirmed a total of 3,723,639 cases of Colvid-19 of which 100,052 proved fatal and 3,612,081 resulted in recovery. Vaccinations administered to date amount to 20,973,752.
