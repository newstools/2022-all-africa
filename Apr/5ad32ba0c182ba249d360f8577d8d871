Gambian President Adama Barrow's party won a narrow victory in legislative elections but fell short of the majority needed to govern the West African country alone, results showed on April 10, 2022.           The president can designate the five other lawmakers, including parliament's speaker, who will be selected from his party in the coming days, but fell short of an absolute majority in the 58-seat chamber.           Barrow won a second term in office after defeating Ousainou Darboe in last year's presidential election with 53% of the vote, in the country's first open transition of power since the dictatorship of Yahya Jammeh.           Barrow, 57, faces numerous challenges, including soaring inflation, shortages, national reconciliation and fighting corruption.           He promised to introduce constitutional change by the end of his term, but in September 2020 the outgoing parliament rejected a draft constitution limiting the president to two terms.           Barrow has also been urged to respond to recommendations from a commission that investigated crimes committed by the state under the Jammeh regime.
