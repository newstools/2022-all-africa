UN News Service reports that Ethiopia's eastern Somali region has been hit by three consecutive below-average rainy seasons, which is worsening the already deteriorating humanitarian situation for around 3.5 million people - more than half the local population. Somali region's President Mustafe Mohammed Omer said this is the worst drought in forty years. In this region, livestock is an essential means of survival for the large majority of people, and the key to generating income in local markets. Millions have lost their livelihoods, and been forced to move to places where they can receive humanitarian assistance from local people, government, or humanitarian organisations.           The UN is supporting longer-term government and community efforts to help communities be better prepared to cope with droughts and other risks in the future and is working to improve coordination between all humanitarian bodies in the region.
