The ongoing crisis in the north-west and South West regions of Cameroon, coupled with the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, has pushed the price of stable foods beyond the reach of many.           Most businesses in Bamenda, the north-west's capital, have been shut down and relocated to safer areas after the kidnapping of many business people. Some have also had their places of business burnt down. Peaceful protests five years ago led to a brutal crackdown by security forces, resulting in separatists taking up arms against the central government.           The Russian invasion of Ukraine has forced prices up as has the impact of Covid-19 says Abel Ghogomu, a local government representative in charge of trade in the region. Ukraine and Russia are large-scale producers of wheat flour.
