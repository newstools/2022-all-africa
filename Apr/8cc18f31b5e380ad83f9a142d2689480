Nigeria's nanotechnology journey, which started with a national initiative in 2006, has been slow. It has been dogged by uncertainties, poor funding, and a lack of proper coordination. Still, scientists in Nigeria have continued to place the country on the map through research publications, writes Professor Agbaje Lateef for The Conversation. Nanotechnology creates, uses, and studies materials at nanoscale - one nanometre is a billionth of a metre. Some of these materials occur in nature - with  DNA, proteins and viruses as examples. Nanotechnology would benefit Nigeria in several ways. In agriculture, nanomaterials can be exploited as slow-release fertilisers and eco-friendly agents against pests and diseases. There are applications in renewable and clean energy generation, through biofuels and solar panels. In security, nanomaterials in gadgets and vehicles can enhance the protection and capabilities of personnel, with a potential for smart uniforms with ultraviolet protection, antimicrobial properties, camouflaging, and resistance to water and fire.
