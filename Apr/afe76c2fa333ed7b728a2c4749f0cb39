On March 28, 2022 bandits attacked a Kaduna-bound train carrying 970 passengers. At least eight people were killed, and 168 were kidnapped and are still missing. This unprecedented act of violence has been attributed to the failure of authorities to act on intelligence report. It has heightened concerns about a breakdown of security in the country, writes Oluwole Ojewale, Adewumi Badiora, and Freedom Onuoha for the Institute for Security Studies (ISS). Research by ISS has shown an increasing nexus between bandits and militant groups such as Boko Haram and Ansaru, a de facto branch of Al-Qaeda in Nigeria. These violent extremists are key players in the violent crimes and terror activities in the northwest and north-central Nigeria. The assailants used explosives to blow up the rail track before firing at commuters. Within 24 hours, another assault was carried out on the same stretch of tracks using improvised explosive devices, forcing the train travelling from Kaduna to Abuja to stop. The Abuja-Kaduna railway, inaugurated by President Muhammadu Buhari for commercial services in July 2016, is vital to Kaduna - a major industrial and administrative city in Nigeria's north. The Abuja-Kaduna train generates at least U.S.$721,780 for the country every month and has improved the country's investment potential. It promotes business, travel, and cargo transport between the two major cities. Economic development along the railway line and in nearby cities has also been boosted. The Nigerian Railway Corporation has suspended the operation on the route. It said that repair work on the blown-up track and the damaged coaches of the train has commenced, and that operation will resume immediately after completion.
