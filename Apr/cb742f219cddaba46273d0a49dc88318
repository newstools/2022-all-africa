The South African government has welcomed rating agency Moody's decision to affirm South Africa's long term foreign and local currency debt ratings, revising the outlook from negative to stable. According to Moody's, the key driver behind the decision, is the improved fiscal outlook that raises the likelihood of government's debt burden stabilising over the medium term. The decision comes several months after the unemployment rate in the country reached at all-time high at 34.9%. The Covid-19 pandemic was also cited as a factor surrounding rising job losses.
