A spate of up to seven murders over the past weekend has driven tension in the Gauteng township of Diepsloot, over the past several days, Times Live reports. Residents threatened to shut down the area and called for greater police presence and action. One case in particular saw the death of a 20-year-old man during a robbery which further aggravated the community, according to Kutlwano Moalosi, Diepsloot's community policing forum secretary. Frustrated residents took to the streets to demonstrate, demanding a meeting with Police Minister Bheki Cele. The resulting protests against the area's high crime rate entered their third day before an eventual appearance by Cele. The minister outlined forthcoming action by the police which included the deployment of a dedicated team of detectives to the area within 24 hours to solve the outstanding cases. Additionally, several alleged foreign nationals were arrested following the protests, according to eNCA. After several hours, the protests escalated to alleged mob action with community members roving the township demanding to see residents' passports or identity documents to determine their nationality. "Community members were doing door-to-door [checks] because of the frustration that happened over the weekend. Then when they got to a yard, a guy jumped out of his shack and ran. The community got to him and burnt him," said Moalosi.
