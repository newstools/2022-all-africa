The World Health Organization has provided the Malawi  government with 1, 947, 695 doses of oral cholera vaccines, that will be administered in the eight districts of Nsanje, Chikwawa, Mulanje, Phalombe, Blantyre, Machinga, Balaka and Mangochi. Apart from this donation, the country also received some critical tools in the fight against other diseases, that included diagnostic aids, laboratory supplies, essential medicines and supplies. Malawi has been recording a rise in cholera cases, which health authorities blame on flooding from a recent tropical storm and a cyclone. More than 30 people have been infected and two have died in southern Malawi. Malawi confirmed the first cholera case March 2, 2022 in the Machinga district.
