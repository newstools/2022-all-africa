Mass burials have taken place in Plateau State after scores died during attacks by armed gangs in several villages. The authorities have yet to determine the number of casualties from the attacks but residents say more than 150 bodies were recovered. Armed gangs invaded the villages in broad daylight on August 10, 2022, shooting sporadically and torching houses. Locals said the victims included farmers who were tilling their fields in preparation for the planting season. The attackers abducted dozens of people, including women and children, VOA reports. No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks. Nigeria is grappling with a wave of violence by armed gangs who frequently carry out killings and kidnappings for ransom - mostly in unprotected rural communities.
