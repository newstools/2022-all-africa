Although Somalia now has a quota system for female lawmakers, women are frequently held back from pursuing leadership roles due to pervasive cultural and social barriers.           It's not easy being a female politician in Somalia.           Men have long dominated national and local leadership roles in the Horn of Africa nation, largely due to deeply ingrained traditional prejudices.           Somalia has established a 30% seat quota for female lawmakers. But the Somali Women Association has accused regional clan presidents of overlooking or turning down potential candidates, leaving the quota unfilled. For young Somali women determined to make a difference, change begins with better representation of women in the executive branch of the government. Only four women hold ministerial positions within Somalia's current federal government, while 14 women hold seats on the upper house and 51 in the lower house, reports Mohamed Odowa and Ineke Mules for Deutsche Welle.
