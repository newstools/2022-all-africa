The killing of Elvis Nyathi, a Zimbabwean citizen who lived in Diepsloot, Johannesburg has prompted the Centre for Analytics and Behavioural Change (CABC) to unpack the online tactics that resulted in his death. The CABC released a report highlighting how online posts stoked xenophobic tensions between South Africans and migrants. A spate of several murders in Diepsloot had already strained relations between local and non-South African residents with Nyathi's killing culminating after a series of anti-crime protests in the area spurred by Operation Dudula, a "self-appointed watchdog on the issue of illegal immigrants", according to the CABC.
