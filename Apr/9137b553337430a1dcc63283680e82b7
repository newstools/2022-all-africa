Kenyans are scrambling to meet the requirement that, if not adhered to, will lead to the permanent switching off of thousands of Safaricom, Telkom and Airtel SIM cards intended to decrease cases of digital fraud and cybercrime, according to the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA). Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission Communications (IEBC) Authority Director-General, Ezra Chiloba, has said the ongoing SIM card validation is mandatory for all users and has nothing to do with elections. Chiloba said the exercise is targeting unregistered users. Anyone who confirms through *106# that their Identity Card is registered on their lines, does not need to register afresh and those who will not comply will be switched off on April 15, 2022 as directed. According to the CA boss, "looking at the situation across the country currently, the compliance levels on SIM card registration are not looking good." The Kenya Human Rights Commission has warned that the move by government, compelling Kenyans to register their SIM cards threatens the privacy rights of citizens, reports Capital FM.
