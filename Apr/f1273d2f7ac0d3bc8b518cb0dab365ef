The European Union's (EU) foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on April 11, 2022 that the bloc will wind down some of its training of Mali's forces, casting further doubt on the future of EU and UN peacekeeping missions in the region.           The EU is involved in two training missions in Mali - the EU Training Mission (EUTM) and the EU Capacity Buidling Mission (EUCAP) - alongside the UN peacekeeping mission, the Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA).           Borrell said that while some training operations would end, the EU's involvement in the Sahel region would continue, suggesting the involvement of security advisors.           The international missions have been supporting local forces in Mali and other countries across the region to tackle widespread Islamist insurgencies.           The political and security instability is considered to be one of the main causes of the military coups in Mali that brought the current military junta into power. Other countries in the region have also experienced coups in recent years.           The news of the EU's partial withdrawal from Mali comes as German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock is set to meet Mali's transitional President Assimi Goita today, April 12, 2022, in Bamako.           Some 300 German soldiers are participating in the EU mission with around another 1,000 deployed with MINUSMA.           The question of Germany's continued involvement in Mali follows the decision by France to end its Barkhane counter-terrorism operations in the country. Mali was once a French colony and the announcement was greeted with celebration in some sections of the population.
