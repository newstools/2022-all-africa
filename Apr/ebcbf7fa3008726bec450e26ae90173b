The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has release its latest report on urgent measures need to avoid the worst of the climate crisis. This follows on from an earlier report looking at the scope of the crisis. Scientists say that as climate-heating fossil fuel emissions continue to rise, renewed efforts to slash them must be fair and take into account countries' other key priorities - such as development in poorer nations - or they will likely fail. But "if you do that at the expense of justice, of poverty eradication and the inclusion of people, then you're back at the starting block", said Fatima Denton, one of its 278 authors.
