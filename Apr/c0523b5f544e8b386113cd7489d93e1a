Cameroonians living in the US who lived in fear of imminent deportation have been given an 18-month reprieve by the US government, according to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).           Human rights groups in the US and Cameroon have been lobbying for this Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for years due to the Anglophone Crisis and the violence carried out by Boko Haram in the far north of the country. Separatists have been fighting to create an independent English-speaking state in the majority French speaking nation since 2017.           This reprieve, which Cameroonian asylum seekers already in the US can apply for, will last 18 months, but will only start once a federal register is published. Those eligible and in detention will be released once they receive the TPS designation. The government says the latest victims of separatist brutality are four top prison officials in the northwest region, who were killed Tuesday by the fighters.           Deben Tchoffo is the governor of the northwest region says the fighters killed and mutilated bodies of four prison leaders while they were on duty.
