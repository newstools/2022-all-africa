The British army has lost diplomatic immunity on lawsuits over the 10,000 acre bush fire in Nanyuki, that was set by its soldiers, who were allegedly drugged. In the landmark ruling, Justice Antonina Bore argued that the UK government waived diplomatic immunity to legal action when it signed an agreement in 2015, governing the terms under which its soldiers would be allowed to operate in the country. According to the judge, the British Army has no legal entity separate from the UK government. He opined that the 2015 agreement did amount to a partial waiver of diplomatic immunity. According to Capital FM reports, a wildfire at Lolldaiga Hills Ranch - a 49,000-acre sanctuary which houses the Nanyuki army base used by Britain for military drills - broke out in March 2021 and caused widespread devastation.
