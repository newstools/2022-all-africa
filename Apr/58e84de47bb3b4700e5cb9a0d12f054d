The Federal High Court has barred journalists and members the public from attending proceedings in terrorism-related cases. In a statement titled "new practice directions on hearing of terrorism cases", Justice John Terhemba Tsoho also said coverage of any part of such proceedings would be prohibited. He said the new ruling was designed to ensure the security and safety of all parties and members of the public and to ensure fair trials. The directive comes amidst the ongoing terror prosecution of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a group wanting independence from Nigeria. Kanu, who is being tried at the Federal High Court in Abuja, is accused of various offences, including treasonable felony and terrorism, offences he allegedly committed in the course of his separatist campaigns.
