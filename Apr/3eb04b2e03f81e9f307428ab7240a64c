Gambian Bai Lowe, accused of belonging to a death squad, appeared in court in Germany on April 25, 2022 on charges of crimes against humanity. Lowe is also accused of murder and attempted murder as part of a group that assassinated opponents of dictator, former president Yahya Jammeh.  German federal prosecutors allege that the unit was used by Jammeh to carry out illegal killings and to intimidate Gambian citizens and suppress the opposition, among other things.           This is the first prosecution in the world for human rights violations committed in Gambia during the Jammeh era, on the basis of universal jurisdiction.           Another alleged death squad member, Michael Correa, was charged in the U.S. in June 2020 with the torture of people who were detained after a failed coup attempt against Jammeh in 2006. However, his trial has been delayed because of the novel coronavirus pandemic.           Jammeh took power in a bloodless coup in 1994, ruling the country as the head of a military junta before his election as president in 1996. His 22-year-long rule was characterised by massive human rights violations, including the repression of the LGBTQ+ community and opposition figures. Jammeh was eventually forced to leave the country in 2017 after losing a 2016 election to President Adama Barrow.           Jammeh is now thought to be living in exile in Equatorial Guinea.
