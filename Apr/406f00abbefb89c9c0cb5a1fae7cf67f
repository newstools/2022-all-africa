Former Big Brother Naija housemate Khafilat Kareem, popularly known as Khafi, is facing a misconduct probe for her appearance on the reality show in 2019. According to BBC, Khafi called one of the Metropolitan Police's most senior officers asking him to reverse the order for her not to do so. However, she participated in the reality TV show in Nigeria "without authority".  Khafi argued that the show was an avenue to "promote the Metropolitan Police" globally. She spent 77 days on the show before being evicted. After the show, Khafi married fellow housemate Gedoni Ekpata, and they have a son together.
