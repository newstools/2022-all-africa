Rangers at the Kahuzi-Biega National Park in the DR Congo are allegedly behind the rape and killing of indigenous people, with the aim of driving them out of the park, which is largely funded by Germany.           The park is home to the indigenous Batwa population. They are descendants of the original rainforest inhabitants and today a disadvantaged and impoverished minority. Some 6,000 people were expelled from their land in 1976, six years after the park was established. There have been repeated conflicts since.           Villagers have said that the attackers were park rangers and DR Congo soldiers. Chief Mbuwa Kalimba Bachirembera is convinced that the park administration wants to drive the Batwa people out of the park - although it includes their ancestral land.           Park director De-Dieu Bya'ombe Balongelwa has denied all allegations. In a written response to Deutsche Welle which published the story, the director said that there has never been targeted violence in the park and that he has never ordered such attacks. Balongelwa said he sees himself as the victim of a conspiracy aimed at ousting him as park director. Meanwhile, the Batwa from Bugamande have decided to return to their village. The fear is great that they will be expelled again. Therefore, they hope that the reports on the violations in the media will help draw attention to their fate and protect them.
