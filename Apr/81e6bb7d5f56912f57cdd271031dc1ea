Mozambican Labour Minister Margarida Talapa has warned that the use of child labour could lead to the banning of Mozambican products on the international market. Speaking at the opening of a national conference on the elimination of child labour, Talapa said "While child labour is often regarded as a social problem with mostly economic causes, it is important to note that, in an increasingly competitive market, the use of child labour could lead to the banning of our products, since they will be considered as unfair and damaging competition".  Meanwhile, United Nations officials have received increasing reports of the use of children in armed groups and other violations - including abduction and sexual violence by militant Islamist groups in Mozambique's Cabo Delgado region. In a part of the territory of northern Mozambique controlled by the militants, officials from the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) said that thousands of children are at risk. Child labour is prevalent in many African countries in Africa where it has negatively affected well-being of children.
