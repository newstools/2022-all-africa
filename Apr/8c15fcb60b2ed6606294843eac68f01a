The South Africa-based energy and chemical giant says it no longer plans to invest in a planned gas pipeline from Mozambique to South Africa to avoid being locked-in to costly fossil fuel infrastructure in the longterm, according to BusinessTech. As the worst effects of the climate crisis are being felt across the world, but more especially in Africa, fossil fuel companies are coming under increasing pressure to move to more sustainable forms of energy. The company instead plans to focus on options that involve less investment considering the company's predictions of higher gas demand following an exit from coal. Liquified natural gas (LNG) imports are another area of focus. Plans between South Africa and Mozambique to utilise LNG began in 2016 when the two countries intended to grow their respective economies and produce jobs.
