Malawian authorities should cease harassing journalist Gregory Gondwe, drop any attempt to force him to disclose his sources, and reform the country's laws so they are not used to censor the press, the Committee to Protect Journalists has said. Minister of Information and Digitalization, Gospel Kazako, who is also the government's spokesperson assured the media that the government will investigate the circumstances that led to Gondwe's arrest on April 5, 2022 at the Committee to Protect Journalists office in Blantyre. Gondwe's computers and phones were confiscated, in what the police described, was a "normal crime-busting exercise." The outgoing national police publicist James Kadadzera confirmed the arrest, saying that Gondwe was arrested for a story published in relation to the huge sums of money the Anti-Corruption Bureau allegedly paid to businessman Zuneth Sattar against the advice of Attorney-General Thabo Chakaka Nyirenda. The police officers reportedly forced Gondwe to disclose the source of the document, referred to in the story.
