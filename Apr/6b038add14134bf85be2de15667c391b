Days after announcing a humanitarian truce, the Ethiopia government accused the Tigray People's Liberation Front of blocking trucks carrying critical food aid to Tigray.           More than 40 trucks were due to depart this week from Semera, capital of the Afar region. But a government statement says the trucks have not left because Abala Road has been closed by militia.           Writing on Twitter, Kindeya Gebrehiwot, a member of the Tigray regional government, accused Ethiopian authorities in Addis Ababa of deception and criticised the international community for welcoming the truce without ensuring the Ethiopian government would follow through.           Meanwhile, Tracey Jacobson, the U.S. ambassador to Ethiopia, visited the Afar region on March 31, 2022, where a meeting was held with Afar regional president Awol Arba and community members to discuss fighting, which has spilled over from Tigray into Afar.
