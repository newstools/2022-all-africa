Militants have turned Kaduna State into a war zone and made travelling between the state and Abuja a nightmare with attacks on road, rail and air facilities. The growing infamy of Kaduna as the most terrorised state in the country in recent times despite the heavy presence of the military and police in the state is raising concerns in the security community. Experts say the security situation does not reflect the fact that Kaduna has some of the most critical military and police establishments in the country. While most states have one military base, a police command and a few other security outfits each, Kaduna has at least 15 military establishments. Militants attack public and private institutions, schools and communities with impunity almost every day. In August 2021, they attacked the country's foremost military training institution, the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) in Kaduna city, five months after an attack on Kaduna Airport's Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) Quarters. Insecurity in Kaduna reached a milestone on March 28 when bandits ambushed a train heading for the city from Nigeria's capital Abuja after bombing the rail track. At least eight passengers were killed in that incident, while 168 others were kidnapped and are still missing, writes Nasir Ayitogo for Premium Times.
