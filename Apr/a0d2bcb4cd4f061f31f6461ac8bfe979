Google and cable landing partner, WIOCC, has announced the landing of its state-of-the-art Equiano subsea cable, expected to significantly impact Nigeria's current and future international internet connectivity demands.  The cable is named after Nigerian-born writer and abolitionist, Olaudah Equiano.  The Equiano subsea cable, which has a capacity that is 20 times larger than any other cable currently serving the African region, would have a direct impact on connectivity, resulting in faster internet speed, reduced internet prices, and improved user experience in Nigeria. The Equiano cable is designed to start in Portugal in western Europe, run more than 12,000km along the West Coast of Africa, and land in Lomé, Togo; Lagos, Nigeria; Swakopmund, Namibia; Rupert's Bay, Saint Helena, and Melkbosstrand, South Africa. Google says the Equiano cable is expected to increase internet speed and create 1.6 million jobs in Nigeria. In 2021, Google announced it plans to invest U.S.$1 billion to support digital transformation in Africa, over the next five years.  The company said that the investment will focus on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans, building helpful products, supporting entrepreneurship and small business, and helping non-profit organizations to improve lives across the continent.
