The Department of Public Works and Infrastructure has said it is working with stakeholders to urgently repair damaged buildings and provide support to install bridges to communities in need, following recent flooding in KwaZulu-Natal province, with parts of the Eastern Cape province also affected.           The damaged buildings include 27 magistrate's courts, 11 police stations, 11 military bases and one museum. Storms in some parts have damaged infrastructure such as roads, bridges, reticulation networks, residential homes, business and public buildings.           This comes after the KwaZulu Natal floods were reclassified as a national disaster by President Cyril Ramaphosa, after an assessment of the damage had been made by the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and other government representatives. Minister Dlamini-Zuma said: "These floods are the worst floods that we have ever seen in living memory. The impact impact of these floods are well beyond the province".           Climate change has been cited as cause of the deluge; the World Health Organization has warned that climate change is now the single biggest health threat facing humanity, but scientists have agreed that the worst impacts can be avoided with coordinated and rapid climate action.
