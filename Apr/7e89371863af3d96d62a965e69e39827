Several people were left injured after a mortar attack struck the area around Somalia's parliamentary building on Monday just as newly elected lawmakers convened for the second time only.           The newly elected members of the Senate and the House of the People were sworn in on Thursday following elections that had been postponed for over a year.           Only 297 out of 329 seats were filled, but lawmakers pledged to move ahead with the electoral process that has been marred by a power struggle between the sitting president and prime minister.           The two houses of parliament will vote on their speakers later in the month, a necessary step before proceeding to the election of the country's new president.
