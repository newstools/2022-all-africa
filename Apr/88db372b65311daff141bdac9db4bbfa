Yatreda is a family of artists that brings the history of Ethiopian kingdoms to life through stunning imagery. With storytelling at the base of their work, they use NFTs to preserve their history and culture for future generations, reports Kylie Kiunguyu for This Is Africa. With NFTs, they can curate unobstructed cultural visions, create unique artistic experiences, and easily share their art with the world. And the collective did just that in 2021 when they released their first-ever NFT project, "Kingdoms of Ethiopia." The portraits told a poignant story of past Ethiopian kings, kingdoms, and warriors. Yatreda's latest NFT "Strong Hair" released in February this year, is a 100 motion portraits of different Ethiopian hairstyles (afros, shaved patterns, and unique braids from remote regions) that capture the diversity and power of African hair.
