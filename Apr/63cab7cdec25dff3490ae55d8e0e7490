Jean-Paul Micomyiza, 49, has finally arrived in Kigali after being extradited from Sweden, where he lived for 15 years. The National Public Prosecution Authority (NPPA) spokesperson Faustin Nkusi issued a statement commending Swedish judicial authorities for the move. The government of Sweden earlier in April 2022 gave the green light for Micomyiza's extradition to Rwanda where he is accused of involvement in the 1994 genocide that arose between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups. The extradition comes three months after a top Swedish Court on December 21, 2021 found no reason why the Rwandan - arrested in the Nordic country in 2020 - should not be extradited to Kigali. Micomyiza is accused of leading a militia that mutilated, murdered and raped during the genocide in 1994. Micomyiza's Swedish lawyers said that they now turn to the European Court of Justice. During the genocide committed against Tutsi in 1994, Micomyiza was a second-year student at the-then National University of Rwanda, in the Faculty of Applied Sciences. As a university student, he was also a member of a committee called Comité de Crise that was instrumental in committing the genocide. The genocide claimed the lives of some 800,000 Rwandans - mainly from the Tutsi ethnic group but also those who were moderate Hutus.
