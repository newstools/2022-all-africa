The Kwazulu-Natal Disaster Management Centre has activated support from the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) as heavy rains continue to batter parts of the province. At least 20 people have died with more missing. In a statement, the provincial Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA) said inclement weather conditions continued to cause havoc across the province. The department urged residents residing in low-lying areas to seek shelter on higher ground, saying disaster management teams had opened public facilities for those that need shelter. "[CoGTA] is working together with social partners and sister departments to ensure that there is interim relief for those that are housed in shelters. So far the extent of the heavy rains is across the province with eThekwini being one of the most affected areas," reads the statement. This comes days after the South African Weather Service (SAWS) warned of rainy and cold conditions, associated with localised flooding is some parts of the country."The SAWS strongly urges the public to avoid crossing rivers and swollen streams, especially in cases where the water is more than ankle deep. SAWS also recommends moving to higher ground if rising floodwaters threaten one's safety," an earlier statement read.
