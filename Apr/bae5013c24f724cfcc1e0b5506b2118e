April 14 marks eight years since 279 schoolgirls were taken by the armed group Boko Haram in Chibok. Some escaped, and others were later released, following intense campaigning by civil society organisations and negotiations by the government.  The girls were sleeping at their school, awaiting exams, when they were taken and at least 100 girls are still being held captive by the militants. The abduction sparked a global outcry.  Since then, abductions have continued. Between December 2020 and October last year, 1,436 schoolchildren - and 17 teachers - were abducted from schools in Nigeria by armed groups. The recent upsurge has triggered prolonged school shutdowns - and in turn led to a decline in school enrolment and attendance, as well as a rise in child marriage and pregnancies of school-age girls. More than 1,500 Nigerian school children have been abducted by armed groups and the Nigerian authorities are failing to protect them, Amnesty International has said in a new investigation.
