At least 168 people have been killed and 110 reportedly injured in attacks between the Arab and Masalit tribes in the Kereinik area of West Darfur that occurred on April 24, 2022. The attack which lasted six hours, claimed the lives of 17 children, teachers, police officers, and worshippers leaving a mosque, according to Radio Dabanga.            For the past two years, West Darfur has witnessed tribal conflicts that have claimed the lives of large numbers of civilians and displaced thousands who are now living in shelters in El Geneina, while some have sought refuge in Chad.           The UN's Volker Perthes said in a statement that he wanted "an in-depth and transparent investigation, the results of which should be made public and help to identify the perpetrators of violence and bring them to justice."
