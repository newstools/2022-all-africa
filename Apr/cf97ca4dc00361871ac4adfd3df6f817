The number of hungry people in the Sahel and West Africa has quadrupled over the last three years, currently reaching 41 million, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) has reported. Issuing the alert, WFP said that the figure rose to 43 million when the Central African Republic was included in the food insecurity estimate. And the problem is not limited to rural areas, as 16 million people living in urban spaces are also at risk of acute food insecurity, with WFP warning that some six million children are undernourished in the Sahel. From conflict and displacement to climate shocks and inflation - all made worse by the Ukraine crisis - there are many reasons for the unprecedented food emergency in the Sahel and West Africa region. According to WFP, since Russia invaded Ukraine, prices have surged between 30 and 50% in many places - and even doubled in some markets, reports UN News.
