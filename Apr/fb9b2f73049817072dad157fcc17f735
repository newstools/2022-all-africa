The U.S. government has said that human rights violations, impunity, and corruption are major drivers of impunity in Nigeria's security agencies, including the police, the State Security Service, and the army. The U.S. government, through the Department of State, has said this in its 2021 annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. "Impunity, exacerbated by corruption and a weak judiciary, remained a significant problem in the security forces, especially in police, military, and the Department of State Services," the U.S. government said. "Police, the military, and the Department of State Services reported to civilian authorities but periodically acted outside civilian control. The national police, army, and other security services sometimes used force to disperse protesters and apprehend criminals and suspects. Police forces engaging in crowd-control operations generally attempted to disperse crowds using nonlethal tactics, such as firing tear gas, before escalating their use of force." Two of Nigeria's antigraft agencies - the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) were cited for inconclusive prosecution of public officials charged for corruption.
