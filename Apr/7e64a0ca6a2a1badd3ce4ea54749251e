The Burkinabè government has responded to concerns raised at the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) heads of state summit held in Accra on March 25, 2022.           In a press release, ECOWAS said they were very concerned about the duration of the transition set at 36 months and also called for the immediate and unconditional release of former president Roch Marc Christian Kaboré.           According to government spokesperson Wendkouni Bilgo, the duration of the transition was adopted by consensus during the national dialogue. He also assured that consultations have been taking place for three weeks, to discuss the return of former president Kaboré, to a family residence of his choice.           The Burkinabè head of diplomacy Olivia Ragnaghnewendé Rouamba pleaded for support from ECOWAS. She said with the current humanitarian,  security and food situation, drastic measures could push the country into survival mode. She also explained that ECOWAS is not a sanctioning organisation, but rather a support structure. An ECOWAS delegation is expected in Ouagadougou on Friday, April 1, 2022.
