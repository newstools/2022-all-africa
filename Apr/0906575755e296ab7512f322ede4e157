The Supreme Court has sounded the death knell for the constitutional amendment process, popularly referred to as the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), by ruling that it was unconstitutional. The majority ruling by a seven-judge bench found that President Uhuru Kenyatta's involvement in the process was unlawful. In a summarised judgement, Chief Justice Martha Koome further stated that the creation of 70 new constituencies was also against the law. While six judges agreed that the president cannot initiate the popular initiative, Justice Njoki Ndung'u argued that the president can initiate the process, either in his personal capacity or in his official capacity, since he is democratically elected by Kenyans. Chief Justice Koome further announced that they will harmonise the BBI decision, and issue consolidated judgement on April 5, 2022, reports Jemimah Mueni for Capital FM. Opposition Kenya Kwanza leaders have lauded the ruling.       Deputy President William Ruto has said the collapse of the BBI has marked the end to political conmanship in Kenya. He has termed the initiative as a fraud that is aimed at meeting the selfish interests of a few individuals.
