The UN mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) wants authorities to investigate a report of deadly intercommunal violence in Jonglei State earlier this week.           The attack reportedly occurred on Sunday when armed youth from the Murle community carried out cattle raids in two villages in Baidit, UNMISS said, citing various independent sources, including the independent Human Rights Commission.           The victims included three women who were killed by gunshots, and three children who reportedly drowned in the river while fleeing. At least 26 other people were wounded, and at least five houses were burned and other property looted. People also reportedly fled to nearby bush areas, some of whom are currently unaccounted for.           The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) has also responded to the attack. Hamida Lasseko, UNICEF Representative in South Sudan, said she was shocked and deeply saddened to learn children were among the victims.           UNICEF has urged all groups and individuals to make sure that all children and their families are kept out of harm's way and able to survive and thrive."
