President Uhuru Kenyatta has banned any exports or dealings in scrap metal until proper guidelines are put in place to regulate the sector. Kenyatta stated that tough action will be taken against anyone found culpable of vandalism. The president said the moratorium will stay in place until after the government puts in place adequate measures to effectively police the sourcing, trade and export of scrap metal warning that those found culpable for vandalism of state infrastructure will be dealt with firmly. While referring to recent vandalism of electricity transmission infrastructure, the Standard Gauge Railway and communication masts, President Kenyatta termed the acts as economic sabotage saying the government won't tolerate the destruction.
