January 13, 2022, the day where three South Africa produced nanosatellites were successfully launched into space will be remembered as a landmark moment not just for the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) and South Africa, but for the history of Africa's space technology. Built by a team of CPUT students, the nanosatellite constellation named MDASat is designed to collect data that will enhance the security and protection of South African marine resources.  MDASat, which is the first constellation of satellites developed and designed in Africa, will detect, monitor and identify foreign vessels within the South Africa's exclusive economic zone and could help track illegal dumping and fishing. This mission follows on from the successful development, launch and operation of two other nanosatellites namely ZACUBE-1, known as TshepisoSat, and ZACUBE-2's.
