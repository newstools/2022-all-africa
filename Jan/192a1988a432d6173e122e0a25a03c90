Security experts say the recruitment of Nigerian children into violent extremism is hampering efforts by authorities to end the insurgency. The video was published SITE Intelligence Group, monitors militant activity, battle against militants. In the video, young militants around 12 years old are seen shooting two men in the head who are dressed in Nigeria military uniforms. The video also shows many young fighters receiving military training. The extremist group has released footage of child soldiers training in the past too. But security analysts are concerned the latest video will undercut claims by authorities they are gaining ground in the battle against terrorists. ISWAP split from the Boko Haram group in 2016 but the groups remain united in an insurgency against the Nigerian government that has expanded to neighboring Niger, Chad, and Cameroon.
