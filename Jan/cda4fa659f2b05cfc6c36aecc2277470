President Cyril Ramaphosa has authorised the public release of the final report of an investigation by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) into procurement contracts of Covid-19 personal protective equipment by government officials. Ramaphosa authorised the SIU to probe any allegations relating to the misuse of Covid-19 funds across all spheres of government and gave the commitment that if the SIU found evidence that a criminal offence had been committed, it was obliged to refer such evidence to the National Prosecuting Authority. Ramaphosa said: "The submission of the final report is an important step in our fight against corruption in the public and private sectors, and against maladministration ... It is unacceptable that so many contracts associated with saving lives and protecting livelihoods were irregular, unlawful or fraudulent." The SIU investigated an estimated U.S.$936 million worth of alleged irregular contracts relating to the procurement of personal protective equipment. During a virtual briefing in December 2021, SIU Chief Andy Mothibi told Parliament corruption during a health crisis was a "crime against humanity".
