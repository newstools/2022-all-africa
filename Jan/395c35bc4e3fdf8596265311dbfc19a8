Chinese miner, Monalof, is embroiled in a bitter wrangle with villagers in Binga who are resisting is bid to evict them from their ancestral lands. The villagers were recently given a three months' notice to vacate their homes and pave way for the establishment of a coal mine by Monalof. This is not the first group of Binga villagers to be ordered off their ancestral land to pave way for Chinese coal mining projects. In 2021, the government ordered villagers in Dinde to relocate to allow for a similar project in their area after they had resisted. Despite Zimbabwe's abundant potential for renewable power, the country is embarking on a coal-power building spree, much of it to be built and financed by Chinese companies. The increase in coal mining and coal power contradicts Zimbabwe's own policies and strategies, such as the National Climate Response Strategy and the National Renewable Energy Policy, which are supposed to reduce carbon emissions and manage the negative effects of climate change.
