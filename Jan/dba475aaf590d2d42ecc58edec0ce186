Speaking during a media briefing, Umalusi CEO, Mafu Rakometsi, has said that the Class of 2021 was the first Grade 12 cohort to experience the harsh realities of the Covid-19 pandemic for two consecutive years. The Class, therefore, needed more academic support compared to their predecessors. Rakometsi's comments support data provided by a National Income Dynamics Study-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (Nids-Cram) conducted in July 2021 which found that the pupil dropout rate in the country tripled to about 750 000 throughout the pandemic - the highest in 20 years. The study was carried out by 30 researchers, across six local universities, as well as by the Human Sciences Research Council and the Department of Education. As of January 19, 2022, Covid-19 cases across the country total 3,564,578 of which 93,551 proved fatal and 3,380,374 resulted in recovery while 19,257,383 vaccinations have been administered to date.
