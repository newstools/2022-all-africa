Growers and exporters dealing in the avocado export business face an indefinite ban on the export of Hass and Fuerta varieties. Kenya Agriculture and Food Authority director Benjamin Tito noted that the ban, which took effect on November 15, 2021, is aimed at curbing the harvest and export of immature avocados. The ban however exempts the export of jumbo avocado varieties and those having off-season crops. It will remain in effect in order to control the export of undersized crops which have negatively impacted the image of the commodity in overseas markets, writes Carolyne Tanui for Capital FM.
