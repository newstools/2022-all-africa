President George Weah has declared a 3-day state of national mourning following the tragic loss of lives in a stampede in New Kru Town outside Monrovia.           The incident is reported to have taken place during an open-air church service in the area. Reports say at least 30 people are believed to be dead. The stampede reportedly occurred when some criminals in the area attacked the worshippers at the jam-packed crusade with machetes and other deadly weapons, resulting in a big rush to escape.           The president has ordered that the national flag be flown at half-mast at all public buildings throughout the republic while the nation mourns. He urged the police to ensure a speedy and thorough investigation and make sure that anyone found liable be dealt with by the law.
