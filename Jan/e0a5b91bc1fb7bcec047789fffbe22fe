Barely a week after Cyclone Ana left a trail of destruction, Southern Africa is bracing for yet another devastating tropical cyclone. The Southern Africa Development Committee's Climate Services Centre says Tropical Cyclone Batsirai, which is evolving over the South-west Indian Ocean, is likely to affect Zimbabwe, Namibia, Malawi, Tanzania, the Comoros Islands, Mauritius, South Africa, Mozambique, Angola, Zambia and the DR Congo. The region is set to receive abnormally heavy rainfall until February 3, 2022. Tropical Storm Ana caused widespread destruction and triggered flooding across southeast Africa. Fatalities were reported in several countries including Mozambique, Malawi and Uganda.
