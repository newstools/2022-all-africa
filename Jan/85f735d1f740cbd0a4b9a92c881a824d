Western Cape Judge President John Hlophe has set aside an order that the alleged National Assembly arsonist Zandile Mafe be kept at Valkenberg psychiatric hospital for observation. John Hlophe ruled that Zandile Mafe's further detention at the Valkenberg psychiatric hospital was unlawful 'and should come to an end with immediate effect', Marianne Thamm of Daily Maverick reports. Mafe was arrested on parliamentary grounds after a fire broke out on Sunday, January 2, 2022. The 49-year-old was charged with terrorism.
