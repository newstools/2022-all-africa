The first 'named' storm of 2022, Tropical Storm Ana is wreaking havoc in Southern Africa after it intensified on January 23, when it moved towards the tropical waters of the Mozambique channel from Madagascar. Meteorological Services across the region have warned of the possibility of heavy rains and strong winds, as the tropical depression from the Mozambique channel will sweep through eastern parts of Zimbabwe. It is reported, the trail of the storm will also sweep through Malawi, with high probability of localized heavy rain which may reduce visibility and cause flash flooding, strong winds which may carry debris roof sheets or break off tree branches. Tropical storm Ana has already caused widespread flooding in Madagascar, including in the capital city, with a death toll from heavy rains reaching 34 and displacement of more than 55,000 people. This comes as countries in the region are still trying to recover from Cyclone Idai which ravaged Southern Africa in 2019. The continent is feeling the effects of changes in global climate faster and more intensely than other continents.
