Hundreds of people have been shifted to safety after torrential rains caused floods that killed at least 14 people and damaged houses in the Eastern Cape. The Eastern Cape Premier Lubabalo Oscar Mabuyane, cooperative governance and traditional affairs (Cogta) MEC Xolile Nqatha, social development MEC Siphokazi Mani-Lusithi and public works MEC Lubabalo Madikizela have visited East London to support affected families. "No matter how much we need rain as relief to our drought-stricken areas, we do not want lives to be lost at that expense, our hearts are heavy and we send deepest condolences," Amathole District Municipality Executive Mayor Nceba Ndikinda said.
