Antimicrobial resistance poses a significant threat to humanity, health leaders have warned, as a study reveals it has become a leading cause of death worldwide. Hundreds of thousands of people die due to previously treatable infections such as lower respiratory and bloodstream infections because the bacteria that cause them have become resistant to treatment. Based on estimates across 204 countries and territories, the 'Global burden of bacterial antimicrobial resistance in 204 countries and territories in 2019' paper provides the most comprehensive estimate of the global impact of antibiotic resistance to date and reveals that AMR has now become a leading cause of death globally. The paper highlights specific areas of concern and equips governments and health communities with the information they need to act quickly and develop a proportionate response.
