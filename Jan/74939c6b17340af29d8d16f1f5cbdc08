A four-part series by New Frame will examine gender-based violence (GBV) and grassroots activism. The first entry focuses on the Klapmuts anti-GBV community-response team, set up the Ubuntu Rural Womxn and Youth Movement (Ubuntu Rural), a nine-year-old advice office that defends farm workers against unfair dismissals and evictions. Although many from the organisation had no experience in dealing with cases of violence against women and children, they used their activist backgrounds, organising skills and paralegal training to come up with the idea of local, community-led, anti-GBV response teams that would be available for abused women and children around the clock.
