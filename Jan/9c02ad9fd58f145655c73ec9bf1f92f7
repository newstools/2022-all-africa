Disputes between Zulu royal family members over who will succeed to the throne, resulted in drama inside and outside the Pietermaritzburg High Court in the KwaZulu-Natal Province, Daily Maverick reports. Sibongile Winifred Zulu, King Goodwill Zwelithini's first wife, claims she is entitled to 50% of the late monarch's estate. Meanwhile, Queen Sibongile Winifred's two daughters, Princesses Ntandoyenkosi Zulu and Ntombizosuthu Zulu-Duma, want the court to declare King Zwelithini's Will to be a forged document. In the Will, the late king nominated his third wife, the late Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu, as the regent. Queen Dlamini Zulu, in turn, wrote her own Will in which she nominated her own son, Misuzulu Sinqobile kaZwelithini, as the successor to the late Zulu king. Prince Misuzulu's claim to the throne in May 2021 was strongly contested at the time.
