The high-profile corruption trial of Mozambican politicians and officials - followed on live television throughout the country - is drawing to a close with many questions outstanding. So far, it seems the top-level politicians won't be held accountable for their role in the massive debt scandal that has cost the people of Mozambique dearly, writes Borges Nhamirre for the Institute for Security Studies. The country's former finance minister Manuel Chang, who signed the illegal sovereign guarantees allowing the contracting of U.S.$2 billion, has been ordered to stand trial in the U.S. by a South African high court, after his arrest in South Africa while attempting to board a flight to Dubai. He has been in custody in South Africa since 2018. He was awaiting a decision on whether he would be extradited to the U.S. or Mozambique. Judge Margaret Victor had in November 2021, overturned Justice Minister Ronald Lamola's decision to extradite Manuel Chang to Mozambique, calling it 'irrational'. The debt trial has publicised the extent to which corruption and political patronage have undermined governance in Mozambique, writes Nhamirre.
