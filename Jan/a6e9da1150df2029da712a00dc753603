The US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs and the Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa, who are currently visiting Sudan, have strongly condemned the use of disproportionate force against protesters, and stressed that the U.S. will not resume the currently suspended assistance to the Sudanese government without the restoration of a civilian-led government.           Washington has pressured Sudan to end violence against anti-coup protesters and restore a civilian-led government. In a statement via the US Embassy in Khartoum, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Molly Phee, and newly appointed Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa, David Satterfield, say that after meeting with a wide cross-section of Sudanese civil society, they "share the deep concern of the Sudanese people about the disruption of the democratic transition".           As part of broader international punitive measures, the U.S. halted U.S.$700 million (€623 million) in emergency assistance since the military coup in October. Anti-coup protests have rocked Sudan after the military ousted Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok.           A pro-democracy group of medics has said that at least 72 people were killed -- including many by live rounds -- during a clampdown by security forces. More than 100 prosecutors also announced that they would stop work to protest security forces' violations against protesters, according to Reuters news agency.
