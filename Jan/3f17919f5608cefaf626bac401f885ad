Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok resigned after mass protests against a deal he made with the military following the October coup. In a televised address to the nation, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok said he was resigning to make way for another person to lead and called on comprehensive dialogue to end the political crisis that has engulfed the nation for two years. Hafez Kabir a Sudanese political commentator thinks that Sudan will witness "a new crisis because there are many military groups, there are many political groups and their opinion is not the same. The military threatened Sudan's unity. There are many problems on the economic side, social side, so we want a new initiative, comprehensive solution that can save the situation in Sudan." Kizito Sabala, an expert in diplomacy and international relations, says Hamdok's resignation proves that it's difficult to block the military from the country's politics. According to Shakur Nyaketo, a journalist and activist, "new blood is needed to lead the civilian side of the government".           Sudanese youth continue to march in the streets against the military, and the protests are consistently suppressed through force. So far, 57 people have been killed since the military seized power in October 2021.
