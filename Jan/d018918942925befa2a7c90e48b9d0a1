Much of the Guinea worm eradication effort in endemic countries isn't staffed by foreign nationals, but instead relies on local villagers and community members to manage education and prevention efforts at local water sources. South Sudan at one point accounted for almost 80% of global infections. The effort to fight Guinea worm prevailed over civil war and sporadic unrest in South Sudan to reach the point of only four recorded cases in 2021. Mali, Ethiopia, Chad and parts of its border area with Cameroon are among the last strongholds of Guinea worm on the planet. If the remaining endemic countries can get rid the parasite completely, Guinea worm disease would become the first disease in human history eradicated through prevention and not vaccination, reports Kane Farabaugh for Voice of America.
