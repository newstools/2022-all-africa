Join Bands, Not Gangs offers music lessons to vulnerable teens in dangerous Western Cape neighbourhoods, encouraging those at risk to choose an instrument rather than a gun, Jan Bornman of New Frame reports. Join Bands, Not Gangs works with prevention and intervention in mind. The music classes prevent at-risk youth from entering gangs by giving lessons to children between eight and 14. The intervention aspect of Join Bands, Not Gangs focuses on working directly with street gangs by using music as a tool to build friendships between gang members. "By using this approach to peace we believe over time we can create a common denominator between rivals in that they all participate in music. Counselling services by qualified counsellors are also offered as part of our lessons package," the Join Bands, Not Gangs website says.
