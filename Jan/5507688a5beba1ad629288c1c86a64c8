Political activist and academic Stella Nyanzi has left the country, citing political persecution and threats to her life. In a social media post, Nyanzi noted that she knew it was time to flee yet again when detained writer Kakwenza Rukirabashaija was abducted from his home. "I knew it was time to beat it and flee. I refuse to be gagged. I refuse to be silenced! Critical writers must never be threatened merely for writing critically about brutal abusers of power flourishing under dictator Museveni," Nyanzi said in a post. The 45-year-old flew out to Germany with all her children and this is the second time in nearly two years that Nyanzi flees the country over political persecution reasons. In February 2021, Nyanzi fled to Kenya by bus, disguised as a banana seller in order to beat security at the border, saying that her life was in danger.
