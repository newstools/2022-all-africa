Nomadic herders are among those suffering the most from recurring drought that kills the livestock on which they depend. To make them less dependent on rain, aid programs are teaching herders how to farm fish and keep bees. Makay Mamo, 39, feeds the tilapia fish in her pond, in Kinna ward, Isiolo county. For the last two years, she has been raising fish on her farm, a break from the community's pastoral lifestyle. This change has served her well. As the county deals with a devastating drought that threatens the lives of 2 million people, she has food on her table and surplus for the market. The initiative is meant to cushion residents from the effects of extreme weather conditions like droughts and floods. The program has grown from 15 groups to more than 50. And individual farmers now farm and consume the fish, as well practice crop farming, hay production and bee keeping, writes Brenda Mulinya for Voice of America.
