Nearly 20 years after the United Nations Security Council referred the Darfur situation in Sudan to the International Criminal Court (ICC), victims and survivors of atrocities are still seeking justice and accountability, Prosecutor Karim Khan told ambassadors.           The Darfur conflict began in 2003 between Sudanese Government forces, backed by allied militia known as Janjaweed, and Darfur rebel movements. Hundreds of thousands were killed, while scores more were displaced.           In 2005, the Council referred the case to the ICC, which is investigating allegations of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Four arrest warrants remain outstanding, including one for Sudan's former President, Omar Al-Bashir, who was deposed in April 2019.           The Sudanese authorities committed to work more closely with the ICC and signed the Rome Statute, the 1998 treaty that established the ICC. Agreement had also been reached to ensure a permanent field presence of the office of the prosecutor in Khartoum.
