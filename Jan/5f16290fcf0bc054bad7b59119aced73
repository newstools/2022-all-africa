Political parties have expressed shock and say they are saddened to learn of the tragic fire accident which occurred in an apartment complex in the Bronx, New York, USA on January 9 Killing 19 people including two Gambians and severely injuring many others.           Some commentators on the incident think profit making is at the heart of the dangers involved in the housing market. According to Annia Ciezadlo, "If housing vulnerable people is an asset class - not a social good, or a human right - then generating returns for investors will always be in a zero-sum relationship with providing safe housing for those people. Landlords will always be in the middle; and when they're taking sides, as they must in housing for profit, investors will always win."
