The family of Mali's former President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita announced on Sunday January 16, 2022 that he had died, aged 76, at his home in the capital, Bamako. Keita - known as IBK - had been president of Mali from 2013 until he was forced out of office in 2020 by the military.           Keita was president during a turbulent period that saw a violent Islamist insurgency take over large areas of the centre and north of Mali, Deutsche Welle reports. He was also seen as having struggled to turn around Mali's failing economy. In the weeks before the coup, there were protests over his perceived failure to deal with the crisis and alleged corruption.           Military coup leaders seized Keita and other leaders in August 2021. He was released under pressure from the West African bloc ECOWAS and returned to his home in Bamako, where he was placed under surveillance. Keita suffered a mini-stroke the following month, for which he had to be treated in the United Arab Emirates.
