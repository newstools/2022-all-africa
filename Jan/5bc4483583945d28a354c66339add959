A group of local researchers has partnered with Germany-based Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour to track sooty terns' movements by satellite, Seychelles News Agency reports. The project has particular significance to the development of Seychelles' blue economy and marine spatial plan as it identified the areas that juvenile sooty terns have been flying to, possibly linked to the areas where there is high food availability. It was through this project that the institute contacted SeyCCAT - Seychelles Climate Change Adaptation Trust - which funded the project, asking if it would be possible to deploy up to 300 of their Icarus satellite transmitters in Seychelles.
