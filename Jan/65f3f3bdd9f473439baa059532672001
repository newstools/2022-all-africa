Businessman Jimi Wanjigi, a former ally of both President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leader Raila Odinga says he does not know why the police raided his Kwacha office in Westlands, on the night of January 17. Speaking to Capital FM News on phone, Wanjigi who is also an ODM presidential aspirant stated that heavily armed officers demanded that he accompany them to record a statement but were not willing to disclose what it was about. Wanjigi has denied claims that his arrest is linked to land tussles instead saying it is politically motivated. Wanjigi has been at the centre of a land tussle after two businessmen claimed ownership of a one-acre piece of land on General Mathenge Road in Westlands where his Kwacha offices are located. Recently, he was thrust into a new controversy after obtaining a court order to have the Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti sentenced for failing to honour a court order to return guns confiscated from during a raid at his Muthaiga home in 2017, writes Simon Ndonga for Capital FM. The High Court has issued orders barring security agencies from arresting businessman Wanjigi and his wife Nzisa over a forgery probe pending the hearing of a petition filed before the court. They are accused of forging a title deed between April 9, 2010 and June, 2018 at an unknown place in the Republic of Kenya.
