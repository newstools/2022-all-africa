People living in Nairobi's Kibera area find it difficult to access emergency health care. Even where public services such as clinics and hospitals are provided within the area, the high cost effectively bars most Kibera residents from calling an ambulance.           To tackle this challenge, Moses Omondi who was born and raised in Kibera, has formed a community emergency response team that provides services to residents for a fee of U.S.$1 a month, including ambulance transport to the hospitals. Non-profit groups and other benefactors support the service. So far, there is one ambulance for an estimated 250,000 residents in the area. Officials hope to increase the number to five.           Ambulance services in Kenya ordinarily cost up to U.S.$400 depending on the needs of a patient, such as a ventilator and the distance involved. Residents say the community service emergency response team offers hope they will have better access to the health care they need.
