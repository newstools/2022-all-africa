Nigeria has laid a claim on Tuesday night to be considered among the favourites for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations title with an impressive display in a 1-0 victory over Egypt. The three-time Afcon champions had a tumultuous time heading into the 2021 edition of the tournament, and some important players are absent too. But never underestimate them.           Egypt national team manager, Carlos Queiroz, was full of lamentation as his wards lost a group match for the first time since 2004 to Nigeria in Cameroon.           Sierra Leone on the other hand marked their return to the Africa Cup of Nations after more than two decades with a gutsy draw against the defending champions Algeria. In the prelude to the match at the Japoma Stadium in Douala, the Algeria skipper Riyad Mahrez said retaining the trophy would be an altogether different challenge.
