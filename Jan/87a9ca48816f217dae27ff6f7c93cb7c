Although the African continent accounts for the smallest share of global greenhouse gas emissions, its nations continue to hold the unenviable position of being disproportionately vulnerable to climate change and it is already heating faster than the rest of the world. If the target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels is missed, Africa could be facing catastrophic temperature increases of up to 3°C by 2050.  This means adaptation to changes in climate are even more important for African countries. While developed nations agreed in the Glasgow pact to double climate change contributions to their developing counterparts by about £29 billion by 2025, this amount is just a fraction of what's needed, writes Margaret Kadiri for The Conversation Africa.
