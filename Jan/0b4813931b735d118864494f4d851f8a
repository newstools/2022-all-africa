The Supreme Court of Liberia has handed down two-year prison sentences to former defence chief Brownie Samukai along with deputies Joseph Johnson and James Nyuman Ndokor after they failed to return U.S.$1,1 million worth of stolen money from a government pension account. The funds were stolen from the Armed Forces of Liberia pension account during the mandate of former President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf when Samukai headed the defense ministry. The three men were ordered by the court to pay a total of U.S.$500,000 within six months but failed to do so. The ruling means Samukai will not be allowed to serve as Senator of Lofa County. However, supporters of Samukai have described the court's ruling as a plot against the senator-elect.
