In 2020 the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)  revealed that Isabel dos Santos, reportedly Africa's richest woman, built her estimated $2 billion fortune on the back of insider deals with the help of shell companies and an array of Western lawyers, accountants and wealth managers.  Now, in the wake of sanctions imposed on Dos Santos and former Angolan officials by the United States - and a European clampdown on the businesses of selected Angolan tycoons, the ICIJ has used leaked documents to link Dos Santos and her partners to at least 20 more secretive companies in the United States and other tax havens.  Although Dos Santos did not respond to the latest allegations, she has in the past strongly disputed allegations over the source of her wealth, charging her accusers of political persecution. She has claimed to be the victim of an orchestrated attack by her father's successor, President João Lourenço.
