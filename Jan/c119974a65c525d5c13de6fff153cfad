Lassa fever, a viral disease, has again resurfaced in Nigeria, with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) warning that it is ravaging many communities across the country. Humans are infected with the virus through exposure to food or household items contaminated with urine or faeces of infected mice or rats, the NCDC says. The symptoms of Lassa fever are varied and non-specific and clinical diagnosis could be difficult, especially in the early stages. The NCDC has advised that steps should be taken by the government to direct all health facilities in the country to emphasise routine infection prevention and control measures, writes This Day.
