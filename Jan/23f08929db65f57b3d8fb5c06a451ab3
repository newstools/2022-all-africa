Kenya Power says innovation plans are in top gear to have the country move into the all-electric vehicle space. The government is critically looking on the matter with a view of making it easier for individuals who wish to buy electric vehicles in the country, according the utility firm's Acting Managing Director Rosemary Oduor. Kenya Power in March 2021 partnered with United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in a pilot launch of electric bikes project in Kenya. The firm received 25 e-bikes for its meter readers that will be used to test the usage of the motorcycle. The utility is looking at the electricity charging points as new revenue streams in its race to diversify from selling power to homes and businesses. Kenya Power intends to establish charging stations for electric vehicles in parking lots, key roads, and shopping malls, with its workshops functioning as after-sales service facilities, writes David Ayega for Capital FM. Kenya's venture into the electric market space hopes to reduce reliance on petrol and diesel. This however comes at a time when the country's power provider is sinking into a near dire financial position with operating costs rising faster than revenue, worsened by elevated financing costs and system losses.
