Humanitarian group Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) says four consecutive attacks of unprecedented violence hit the sites of Tché, Drodro, Paroisse, Luko and Ivo, between 12 and 28 November 2021. This new escalation of conflict has worsened the humanitarian and security situation at the internally displaced people's sites in the area while increasing the vulnerability and isolation of people.           The group says more than 40,000 people have been forced to take refuge in the camp of Rhoe in the Blukwa State health area - an area that is difficult to access and where humanitarian groups have a reduced presence due to recurring security problems.           Originally, the clinic set up in the camp was intended to refer patients requiring more intensive care to the better-equipped general referral hospital in the town of Drodro. However, following the latest clashes that destroyed parts of Drodro and forced people into the camp of Rhoe, the clinic has been transformed into a field hospital to help the now more than 65,000 people - an increase of 40,000 people in two months.
