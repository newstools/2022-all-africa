Human Rights Watch has released its World Report for 2022, which gives a country-by-country review of human rights in more than 100 states over the last year.           In the report released on January 13, 2022 the the monitoring group criticises governments in the western Sahel region Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso  and their international partners, including France, the EU and the U.S., for their reluctance to hold security forces to account for human rights abuses.           Sahel governments -  have rejected accusations by HRW that their armed forces are committing atrocities. For example, Burkina Faso's government denied a HRW report in 2020 saying that more than 180 people were executed and buried in a mass grave in the northern town of Djibo.           "The conventional wisdom these days is that autocrats are in the ascendancy and democratic leaders are in the decline, but when we looked back over the last year, we found that that view is actually too superficial, too simplistic," said Kenneth Roth, Human Rights Watch executive director, in an interview with VOA.
