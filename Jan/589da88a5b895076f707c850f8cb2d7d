Against practice standards, Nigerian health workers, especially in public health institutions, ascertain the marital status of women to decide whether or not to give them contraception, writes Chiamaka Okafor for Premium Times. Unmarried women are often denied contraception while for married women, their husbands' consent is usually sought before contraception is issued. In some cases, unmarried women are advised to get married. Nigeria is projected to become the third most populous country in the world by 2050, with an estimated population of over 400 million due to its annual growth rate of 2.6%. This questions the nation's continued commitment to bridging the huge family planning access gaps across the country, writes Thelma Chioma Abeku for Nigeria Health Watch.
