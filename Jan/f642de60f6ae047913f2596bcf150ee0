Separatists in western Cameroon have released eight rubber plantation workers they abducted earlier this month. But the anglophone rebels are still holding onto five government officials and a top chief they abducted months ago in Cameroon's Northwest Region.           Fighters on social media platforms including Facebook and WhatsApp say the workers were released after pledging never to collaborate with Cameroonian soldiers deployed to fight the separatists. The whereabouts of five government officials abducted by separatists in the town of Ndian last year are still unknown.           Separatists in English-speaking western Cameroon launched their rebellion in 2017 after what they said was years of discrimination by the country's French-speaking majority. The conflict has killed more than 3,000 people and displaced more than a half-million.
