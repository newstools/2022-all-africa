Environmental activists are preparing for another legal battle against a planned seismic survey. This comes less than a month after the Makhanda High Court granted an interdict against oil giant Shell over its intended exploration of the Wild Coast off the province of the Eastern Cape. Now, Searcher Seismic - a geoscience data provider serving petroleum and mining companies - seeks to conduct a 2D and 3D seismic rectification project between the Namibian border and Cape Agulhas. The Australian data supplier was granted a reconnaissance permit by the Petroleum Agency SA (PASA) in May 2021. According to PASA, a Reconnaissance Permit allows the holder to undertake geological, geophysical or photogeological surveys and any remote sensing techniques. Following their victory against Shell, environmentalists are preparing for another legal battle.
