Leaders who have examined the World Health Organisation's (WHO) financial health explained why making the world safer and healthier means WHO's member states must tackle its long-term funding challenge. WHO's funding needs have recently been highlighted by multiple independent reviews into the pandemic response, and are now under the spotlight of governments which are discussing how to make WHO better able to deliver on the mandate they have given it. The need to make WHO financially fit for purpose was also stressed by G20 leaders who acknowledged that "an adequately and sustainably funded WHO" was needed to deliver on work to lead and coordinate global health.
