A shipment of 1.1 million Covid-19 vaccines to Rwanda has brought the total delivered by the global treatment initiative to more than 1 billion. Despite this, as of January 13, 2022, out of 194 Member States, 36 World Health Organisation (WHO) Member States have vaccinated less than 10% of their population, and 88 less than 40%. COVAX's ambition to provide equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines was compromised by hoarding and stockpiling in rich countries, among other difficulties. As of January 21, 2022, confirmed cases of Covid-19 from 55 African countries reached 10,485,879 while over 204,551,125 vaccinations have been administered across the continent.
