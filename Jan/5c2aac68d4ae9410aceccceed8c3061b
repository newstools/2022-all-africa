Relations between the two countries have been rocky since Burundi accused Rwanda of backing a coup attempt against it in 2015. Most of the Burundian military and political players suspected of plotting the coup were granted refugee status in Rwanda, which soured relations. Now, the two governments are talking, and their relationship has warmed to a degree, as officials from both countries have met at the level of military intelligence, provincial governors, foreign affairs ministers and senate presidents. Rwanda's Prime Minister Edouard Ngirente even participated in Burundi's 59th Independence Day Celebration, where Burundi's President Évariste Ndayishimiye pledged to restore ties with his northern neighbour. The history of violent conflict in the two countries and the Great Lakes region has produced scores of refugees. As insecurity in the Great Lakes deepens, the commitment of both countries' leaders to normalise relations is a positive step, writes Paul-Simon Handy, Institute for Security Studies Regional Director for East Africa and the Horn and Antoine Prosper Estime, an independent political analyst focusing on African peace and security.
