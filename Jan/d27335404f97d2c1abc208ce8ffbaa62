The former Zimbabwe captain Brendan Taylor says he will be hit with a multi-year ban over his delayed reporting of a match-fixing plot. The 35-year-old says he was blackmailed to engage in match fixing by a group of Indian businessmen he met in October 2019, after they took photographs of him taking cocaine.  However, Taylor says he did not match fix, but admits he did not report the incident to the International Cricket Council (ICC) for four months, which he accepts was "too long a time". He also wrote on Twitter that he will be checking into a rehabilitation centre to tackle his substance abuse issues. The scandal comes barely a year after the ICC slapped an 8-year ban on former Zimbabwe cricket captain Heath Streak, for corruption.
