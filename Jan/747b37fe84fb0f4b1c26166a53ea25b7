The Soweto Cycling Academy was started to get children on bikes. Now its young members are beginning to compete in South Africa's top races, with an eye on a busy 2022 calendar, writes Outlwile Tsipane for New Frame. The academy started without many resources or much equipment, but its vision has always been clear. Today, the Soweto Cycling Academy has basic equipment that caters to about 70 members. There are only two members who are older than 17, and they have been there since the academy started. More than 40 of the children are registered with Cycling South Africa, the national body that governs the sport. Those who remain unregistered are still working on handling the rigorous demands of cycling.
