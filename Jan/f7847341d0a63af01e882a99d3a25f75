Tourism Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has come under fire after launching her campaign for the presidency of the ruling African National Congress (ANC). Sisulu, who has held no fewer than six cabinet positions, said in an article for IOL that saw her make inflammatory comments about the judiciary and the Constitution. Sisulu also described black politicians as "assets for colonised capital". Reaction to the opinion piece has been negative with noted figureheads and journalists including former MEC in the Gauteng provincial government, Firoz Cachalia, and Steven Friedman describing it as vitriolic and misguided, respectively.
