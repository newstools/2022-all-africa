Activists who mounted a successful case against the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) constitutional review process at the Constitutional Court and Court of Appeal have urged Supreme Court justices not to succumb to threats from the Executive while determining the appeal. The activists through lawyer Nelson Havi pleaded with the seven-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Martha Koome to be firm and uphold the Court of Appeal ruling that deemed the BBI process unconstitutional null and void. The activists include economist David Ndii, Jerotich Seii, James Ngondi, Wanjiku Gikonyo and Ikal Angelei. Havi has accused the BBI proponents - President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga - of trying to usurp the will of the people notably by trying to illegally change the country's governing system, writes Davis Ayega for Capital FM.
