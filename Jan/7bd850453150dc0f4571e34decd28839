A fire that is believed to have started in one of the older buildings in the South African Parliament sent a black plume of smoke across Caoe Town Sunday morning. "The roof has caught fire and the National Assembly building is also on fire," a spokesman for the city's emergency services told reporters. "This is a disastrous event that should sadden all of us," President Cyril Ramaphosa said when he inspected the damage. "This is devastating, coming as it does a day after our send-off for Archbishop Desmond Tutu", he said refering to the funeral that was held on January 1 in the nearby Cathedral. A suspect was arrected and an investigation was launched, officials have said.
