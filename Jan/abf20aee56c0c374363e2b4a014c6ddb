The Permanent Representative of Norway and President of the UN Security Council for Sudan, Mona Juul, is expected to hold a session to discuss the situation in Sudan.           This, while the U.S. also scheduled meetings with the diplomatic and security delegation from the Central Intelligence Agency and Sudanese military and political leaders.           A U.S. government source has said that the security delegation comes from within the administrative framework of President Joe Biden, to prevent matters in Sudan from descending into chaos, following Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok's resignation.           There has been a series of mass demonstrations in Sudan against a military coup led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. Protesters are calling for full civilian rule and the return of the military to their barracks. At least 70 people were injured during the January 6, 2022 Marches of the Millions. The deaths came a day after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken appealed on Twitter for Sudanese security forces to "cease using lethal force against demonstrators & commit to an independent investigation." Crackdowns on demonstrations since the October 2021 coup have left at least 60 people dead and many more injured.
