On January 1, 2021, trading under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) kicked off. The trade pact, which seeks to create a single market for goods and services and promote cross-border movement of capital and people, is expected to boost intra-African trade which is currently at only 18% of regional integration. It is also expected to generate jobs for young people and boost the creative sector. These include visual and performing arts, crafts, cultural festivals, photography, music, dance, film, fashion, video games, digital animation, publishing, architecture, and more. A report by the International Trade Centre states that the AfCFTA agreement can create more jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities for young Africans, recommending that ways be established for them to benefit from a single market. Ahunna Eziakonwa, the Director for the UN Development Programme's Regional Bureau for Africa sayas Africa must first recognize the economic value of the creatives and cultural industry. "Achieving the goal of one African market requires a targeted incentives scheme that supports learning, talent development, and promotion in Africa, in addition to relaxing visa regimes to enable Africans, including those in the creative sector, to travel unhindered across borders", she recommends.
