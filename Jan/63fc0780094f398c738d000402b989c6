Denmark will pull its troops out of Mali, just weeks after they arrived, following calls from the West African country's military government for their immediate withdrawal. The Danish soldiers had been planning to be part of an international contingent fighting against the militant insurgency that has spread across several countries in the Sahel region. The junta rejected Copenhagen's argument that it had been invited by late former president Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, who was overthrown by the military in 2020. France and several European nations have urged Mali to allow newly arrived Danish special forces to remain in the Sahel country, but its transitional government insisted on an immediate withdrawal.
