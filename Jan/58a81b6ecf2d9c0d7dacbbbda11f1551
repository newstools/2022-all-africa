President Joseph Biden spoke with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of Ethiopia on Monday January 10, 2022 "to discuss the ongoing conflict in Ethiopia and opportunities to advance peace and reconciliation," according to a read-out released by the White House.  "President Biden expressed concern that the ongoing hostilities, including recent air strikes, continue to cause civilian casualties and suffering," said the statement released after the two leaders spoke. In a Tweet Abiy called it a "candid phone conversation" that he said focused on "current issues in Ethiopia, bilateral relations as well as regional matters." The call comes as U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Jeffrey Feltman is ending his tenure and is being repalced by another verteran diplomat, David Satterfield. Amid some signs that negotations may be possible and the release of some political prisoners, Ambassador Michel Gavin warns, in a blog for the Council on Foreign Relations, "It will be important to resist the temptation of wishful thinking in this moment and to ensure that a desire for a reset of the bilateral relationship does not lead to a selective reading of the latest developments." UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he was deeply saddened by reports that more than 50 civilians were killed and injured in an airstrike in northern Ethiopia.
