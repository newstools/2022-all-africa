Prime Minister, Abdallah Hamdok has resigned in a televised address. This came just hours after at least three civilians were killed as security forces violently suppressed another wave of the Marches of the Millions, that saw hundreds of thousand take to the streets across the country to express their rejection of the military coup d'état of October 25, and the subsequent political agreement, signed by Hamdok with coup leader Gen Abdelfattah El Burhan.           Hamdok said he was unable to combine all the components of the transition to reach a unified vision.           Hamdok's resignation comes just six weeks after he was released from house arrest and reinstated in terms of a political agreement signed with Gen Abdelfattah El Burhan, Commander-in-Chief of the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF), and leader of the military junta that seized power.           Analysts have said that the controversial agreement is "an intermediate stage that allows avoiding the worst effects of the coup, including bloodshed, international isolation, and Sudan's return to its former pariah status in the international community".
