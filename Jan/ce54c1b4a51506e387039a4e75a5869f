Urban planning has been identified as having the capacity to support sustainable urban development in African cities. It can foster healthier environments and lifestyles. It can create healthy and resilient cities. Yet, it has also been blamed for adding to urban problems. It does so through neglect, segregation and non-participation. Addressing issues of rapid urbanisation, climate change and persistent urban poverty in African cities may lie in the involvement of residents and their support for inclusive urban systems. Residents support for, and understanding of urban planning would contribute to inclusive and spatially integrated cities and would provide sustainable and efficient living and working environments. Without strong resident support and involvement. African cities may continue to prove highly problematic and undesirable for habitation in the future, writes Patrick Brandful Cobbinah for The Conversation.
