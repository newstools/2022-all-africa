The Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, has been pushing Mali's military government to allow elections by February 2022. Former Nigerian president and ECOWAS mediator Goodluck Jonathan was in Mali, to meet with the country's transitional leaders, including President Assimi Goita, ahead of an ECOWAS summit on Mali which will be held on January 9, 2021 in Ghana.           ECOWAS has already imposed financial and travel sanctions on members of Mali's military government and is threatening further penalties if the February election deadline is not met.           A coup in Guinea in September 2021 led to the ouster of that nation's president, Alpha Conde. According to Kalilou Sidibé, a professor of political science and international relations at the University of Bamako, ECOWAS and Mali's transitional leaders are likely to come to an agreement on a future presidential election date - one much sooner than the 2026 elections proposed by the military.           President Goita and the ECOWAS delegation spent almost two hours in talks at the Mali presidential palace. Jonathan briefly addressed the media but did not disclose the contents of the January 5, 2021 meeting.
