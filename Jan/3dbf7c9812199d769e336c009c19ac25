Burkina Faso's military says it has arrested eight soldiers for what local media reported was a plot to overthrow the state. At a press conference, Minister of Defence, General Aimé Barthélemy Simporé, announced that 10 soldiers and five civilians had been arrested in connection with the plot. They will be tried by military tribunal.           The country has been rattled by increasingly deadly militant attacks and widespread protests over insecurity. Analysts warn the military may be unhappy with the government and its efforts to halt the attacks.           Burkina Faso has a long legacy of military intervention. In the first 27 years of independence, Burkinabè soldiers staged five coups d'état and one autogolpe - a military coup initiated or abetted by a country's elected leader. The last coup killed the famed Captain Thomas Sankara. He gave Burkina Faso its name, meaning land of the upright people. The coup saw Sankara's second-in-command Captain Blaise Compaoré installed as president.           In 2014, millions of protesters filled the streets demanding that Compaoré adhere to, rather than reform, presidential term limits barring him from contesting another election. The insurrection ultimately forced him to resign and flee into exile. This popular movement then transformed into a political transition to democracy.           The transition was nearly overturned when Compaoré loyalists within the unit staged their own coup d'état in September 2015. But Burkinabè citizens refused to stand by and again took to the streets.
