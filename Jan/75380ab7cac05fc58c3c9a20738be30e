President Lazarus Chakwera has dissolved his cabinet due to graft charges against three ministers. In a televised address he said "all the functions of cabinet revert to my office until I announce a reconfigured cabinet in two days." And added that he would "confront all forms of lawless conduct by public officials." Chakwera came into power on the back of a strong anti-corruption message. Members of the ruling Tonse Alliance accused the president's Malawi Congress Party of nepotism and corruption and worsening the country's economic crisis. The move comes after Attorney General, Thabo Chakaka Nyirenda, had earlier issued a 60 day amnesty to companies and individuals who have had illegally acquired wealth through procurement fraud and corruption to voluntarily pay back the funds or face the law.
