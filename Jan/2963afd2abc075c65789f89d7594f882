Traditional crops and organic farming stakeholders in Tanzania have asked the government to establish a department that would deal with traditional foods and seeds which are in danger of extinction. This will help boost food security as the loss of diverse diets is directly linked to diseases or health risk factors, such as diabetes and obesity, and has a direct impact on the availability of traditional medicines. From providing cures to deadly diseases to maintaining natural ecosystems and improving overall quality of life, the benefits of preserving threatened and endangered species are invaluable. Locally varied food production systems, which are more resilient to climate change, are under threat with agrobiodiversity disappearing and, along with it, knowledge of traditional medicine and local foods.
