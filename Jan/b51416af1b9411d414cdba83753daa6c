The Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) and Fifa have been accused of "going silent" over allegations that female referees were sexually harassed by Zifa officials.  The allegations made against Zifa's referees committee secretary general, Obert Zhoya, and its chairperson, Bryton Malandule were first reported by local media in September 2020 before two of the alleged victims, both referees, officially registered their complaints with the Zifa board.  The allegations were also sent to FIFA, the global game's governing body, the Confederation of African Football (CAF), and the Council of Southern Africa Football Associations (COSAFA). It was not until the victims reported the allegations to police, in December 2021, that a formal investigation was launched.
