A forensics team has reportedly been dispatched to Yala in Siaya to help identify the bodies from the river as part of investigations. This comes after activists Boniface Mwangi and Hussein Khalid of Haki Africa lifted the lid on shocking murders of people killed and their bodies dumped in River Yala. A witness, Okero Kite claims he has retrieved 31 bodies from River Yala since July 2021. On October 10, 2021 alone, Okero says he retrieved 10 bodies. Each of the bodies were reportedly in individual sacks and neatly packed and sealed like a parcel. Boniface posted a thread on Twitter, detailing their visit to Yala Sub County Hospital mortuary where they counted more than 20 decomposing bodies waiting to be buried as they remain unclaimed.
