Unlike COP26, the COP27 Climate Summit on African soil will be the continent's chance to put the needs of vulnerable nations above the interests of rich countries. Despite contributing almost none of the greenhouse gasses that drive the climate crisis, Africa experiences the bitter injustice of climate change, writes Mohamed Adow for African Arguments. From the drought gripping the East, the shrinking Lake Chad in the West, the floods that have devastated South Sudan to the Mozambican communities still not recovered from Cyclone Idai two years on, African countries suffer climate change's most brutal consequences. The Egyptian government has increased preparations for the COP27 Climate Summit, which it will host in Sharm el-Sheikh at the end of 2022. This is a chance to push for the demands of African nations and set timetables to meet national obligations in lowering harmful emissions.
