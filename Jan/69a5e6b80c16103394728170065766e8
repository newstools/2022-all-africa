The troubled southwest is one area of Cameroon that will be hosting Africa's top soccer championship. Residents of towns of Buea and Limbe has said that in the past two weeks there has been a noticeable increase in troops and military trucks on the streets.           Anglophone separatists fighting in Cameroon's west to break away from the majority French-speaking nation have vowed to disrupt the tournament.           The army has confirmed that troops have been deployed to Buea and Limbe to protect soccer players, officials, and fans but a spokesperson declined to comment on the number of troops and armoured vehicles deployed.           Tapang Ivo, spokesperson for separatist group Ambazonia Defense Forces (ADF) has said the ADF has warned the Confederation of African Football that AFCON matches should not take place in the towns, as they are still fighting with government troops.
