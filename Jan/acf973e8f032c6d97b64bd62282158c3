A virtual sitting of the Pretoria High Court has seen testimony exposing the poor level of care and administration provided for the 144 mental health patients of the Life Esidimeni facility who died in 2016. Former deputy director of the Gauteng Department of Health Mental Health Directorate, Hendricka Jacobus, who was responsible for overseeing the NGOs to which patients were moved during the so-called "Marathon Project", testified that the NGOs to which patients were allocated were neither audited nor "properly licensed". The Life Esidimeni crisis made headlines in 2016 when the deaths of the 144 mental health patients who were transferred to 27 unlicensed NGOs were reported. A subsequent probe into the tragedy by the National Prosecting Authority was created and welcomed by welcomed by the public interest law centre SECTION27 and the Life Esidimeni Family Committee.
