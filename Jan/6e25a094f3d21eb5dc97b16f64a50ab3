Nigeria has dropped five places in the 2021 Corruption Perceptions Index, according to Transparency International. The country scored 24 out of 100 points - ranking 154 out of 180 countries. Transparency International argued that corruption is on the increase in Nigeria.  This is Nigeria's second consecutive year of dropping on the corruption list ranking. The country's score dropped from 26 in 2019 to 25 in the 2020 assessment, and further to 24 in the latest 2021 record. The agency listed seven weaknesses that impede Nigeria's fight against corruption while calling for an immediate improvement for the sake of ordinary Nigerians, which include the damning audit report; security sector corruption; failure to investigate high profile corruption cases; illicit financial flows (IFFs); absence of asset recovery, protection of whistle-blowers, and other key anti-corruption legal frameworks; judicial challenges; corruption in the Covid-19 response and Twitter ban, shrinking civic space and intimidation of human rights defenders. The government has consistently claimed that it is reducing corruption, but the ranking may be an indicator that corruption is getting worse in Nigeria. Nigeria is the second most corrupt country in West Africa after Guinea is ranked 150 on the global index.
