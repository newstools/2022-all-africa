Six members of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ), arrested during a flash demonstration in Harare, have been granted bail. Their release comes after the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) urged President Emmerson Mnangagwa to urgently release the teachers amid urgent calls to respect citizens' rights. In a letter written to Mnangagwa, the ITUC Secretary General, Sharan Burrow said workers' conditions have deteriorated to levels far worse than the era of the late former president Robert Mugabe. The educators, who argue that their salaries have been reduced to nothing due to high inflation, are facing charges of participating in an unsanctioned gathering.
