The year started with news of the resignation of Tanzania's Speaker of the National Assembly Job Ndugai. His crime was questioning President Samia Suluhu Hassan's 'excessive' borrowing spree. Calls for him to step down came directly from loyal members of the governing Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), and indirectly from the president, who felt attacked by his remarks.  The speaker had little option than to resign or face a vote of no confidence from his party's MPs. The incident brings into focus the relationship between the executive and the legislature and how party politics impedes checks and balances in Tanzania and the rest of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), writes Ringisai Chikohomero for the Institute for Security Studies.
