The National Railways Office (ONCF) has confirmed that the nation's high-speed train, Al-Boraq, started using green energy as of January 1, 2022. This new measure will allow ONCF, in the short term, to improve the overall carbon footprint, with the equivalent of 120,000 tons of CO2 avoided each year, or 4 million trees planted. Al-Boraq operates between Casablanca and Tangier. The first of its kind on the African continent, the high-speed service was inaugurated on November 15, 2018 by King Mohammed VI of Morocco following over a decade of planning and construction by ONCF. The rail system was designed to cut journey times between the North African country's economic hubs from five hours to just over two, with trains travelling at speeds of up to 320km/h.
