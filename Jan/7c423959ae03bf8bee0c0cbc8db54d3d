Somali leaders have agreed to conclude the long-delayed parliamentary and presidential elections by February 25, 2022. Somalia's international partners welcomed the deal made on January 10, 2022 but a political stand-off between the president and prime minister still has some Somalis skeptical.           The indirect polls were supposed to be held more than a year ago, but were delayed by disputes over how they would be conducted. More recently, President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed and Prime Minister Mohamed Hussein Roble have been at odds over election procedures, heightening the political tensions.           The U.N. office in Somalia has urged Somali leaders to avoid provocations that risk new tensions or conflict and stay focused on delivering a credible electoral process quickly, for the benefit of all.
