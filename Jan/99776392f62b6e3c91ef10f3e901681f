President Cyril Rampahosa has said three new pieces of legislation aimed at fighting gender-based violence (GBV) and femicide are a step in the right direction in the fight against the scourge. The three laws were formulated following the 2018 National Presidential Summit on Gender Based Violence and Femicide which gave rise to the country's National Strategic Plan of Gender-based Violence and Femicide. "I am pleased that despite the significant disruptions caused to the Parliamentary programme by the Covid-19 pandemic, our parliamentarians have passed laws that will strengthen existing provisions around gender-based violence. "I signed into law three pieces of legislation that honour our promises to strengthen the criminal justice system, promote accountability across the state and put support for survivors at the centre of all our efforts," Ramaphosa said.
