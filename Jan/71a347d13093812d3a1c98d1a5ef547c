The matric pass rate has improved by 0.2 percentage points, increasing from 76.2% in 2020 to 76.4% in 2021, according to Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga. Motshekga announced the 2021 matric exam results at the Houghton Hotel where a breakfast was hosted the top-performing learners from across South Africa. "The Class of 2021 was the most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic because they had to endure two consecutive years of harsh exposure to the unrelenting Covid-19 pandemic," said Motshekga. The minister's comments echo that of Umalusi CEO, Mafu Rakometsi, who said that the Class of 2021 was the first Grade 12 cohort to experience the harsh realities of the Covid-19 pandemic for two consecutive years. This was supported by data provided by a National Income Dynamics Study-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (Nids-Cram) conducted in July 2021 which found that the pupil dropout rate in the country tripled to about 750,000 throughout the pandemic - the highest in 20 years.
