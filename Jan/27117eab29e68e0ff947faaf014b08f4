Award-winning author Kakwenza Rukirabashaija has finally been released, his lawyer Eron Kiiza has confirmed. In a statement, Kiiza has said that his client and friend had finally been realised on January 26 morning, and he is seeking medical attention. Deputy Lord Mayor Doreen Nyanjura also said, in a tweet, that she had talked to Kakwenza's wife who confirmed that the award winning novelist had been dumped at his gate, in their Iganga home. Kakwenza had been "kidnapped" at Kitalya prison and whisked away in a tinted double-cabin pick up, moments after he was granted bail on January 25. The re-arrest had sparked off an uproar on social media, with the European Union and United States Ambassador to Uganda Natalie E. Brown, joining voices that called for his immediate release, writes Jonah Kirabo for Nile Post News. The outspoken critic of President Yoweri Museveni's government was arrested in December 2021 following his criticism of Museveni's son Muhoozi Kainerugaba - an army general who many Ugandans believe is positioning himself to take over from his 77-year-old father - describing him as "obese".
