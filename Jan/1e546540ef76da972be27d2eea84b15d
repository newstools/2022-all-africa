At least thirty governors have reportedly endorsed opposition Orange Democratic Movement leader Raila Odinga's presidential bid stating they are confident that he will protect devolution as provided for under the constitution. This comes amid the beginning of the final mass voter registration that kicked off on January 17 amid a call to unregistered eligible voters. The general election will take place on August 9. The exercise set to conclude on February 9 was rolled out in all the 1,450 county wards across 290 constituencies. The IEBC rolled out the second phase of the Enhanced Continuous Voter Registration and Diaspora voter registration after the Commission failed to meet its target of registering 4.5 million new voters having only reached 800,462 new voters in October 2021. Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has declared that he will be contesting for the 2022 presidential elections. This pronouncement comes amidst speculations that the former vice president was planning to shelve his presidential bid in support of Raila Odinga's Azimio la Umoja movement.
