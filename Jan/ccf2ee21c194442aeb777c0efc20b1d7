The Nigerian government has again filed amended charges against the leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu.  Maxwell Opara, Kanu's lawyer described the new charges as a "joke" and said authorities are trying to expand his time in detention. His lawyers say it is the sixth time Nigerian authorities are amending charges against him. The Biafra leader is already facing a seven-count charge including but not limited to terrorism, treasonable felony and incitement of public unrest and violence. The authorities have accused the group of a string of attacks on police stations and government offices in the southeast. The group denies this and has called the accusations an attempt to force it to disband.
