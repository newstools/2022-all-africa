At least 6 people have been killed and houses torched in an attack blamed on Al Shabaab militants in Widhu Majembeni area of Lamu, Kenya. Lamu County Commissioner Irungu Macharia says the attack occurred on 03 January and said security personnel had been mobilised to track down the attackers. The area has gone for several months without an attack after recording several such attacks in 2021. Al-Shabaab fighters have staged several large-scale attacks inside Kenya in retaliation for Nairobi sending troops into Somalia in 2011 as part of efforts by the African Union force in crippling of Al Shabaab's capacity in the region.
