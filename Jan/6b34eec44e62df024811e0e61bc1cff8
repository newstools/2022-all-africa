The government also accused Twitter of working against Nigeria's interests.  The government stipulated that five conditions were to be met before the suspension would be lifted. This included that Twitter pay attention to national security and cohesion, registration, physical presence, and representation in Nigeria, as well as dispute resolution, and local content". The government has said the conditions have been met.
